    <div> Foreword</div>
    <div> In Thin Air</div>
    <div> Even to the ancients , air was not “ nothing .” About 2,500 years ago , the philosopher Empedocles , living in Sicily , postulated that it was one of the four essential materials , alongside fire , water and earth , that comprised the world . Today we take a less prosaic view , knowing that air actually combines many gases , chiefly nitrogen , followed by oxygen , and in small parts argon , carbon dioxide , as well as water vapor , and other things . The fact is that this layer is extremely thin . If Earth were an apple , the atmosphere would compare in thickness to the apple ’ s skin . How this life-giving stuff formed is the subject of the first article in this edition .</div>
    <div> It is estimated that during an average day , adult humans take over 20,000 breaths , equal to about 16 kilograms of air . For those who ascend to high altitudes , the percentage of oxygen in the air is the same as at sea level , about 21 percent . But at greater elevations , the drop in air pressure means that molecules are more dispersed , so that at 5,500 meters the body can absorb just 50 percent of the oxygen taken in per breath compared to at sea level . The ability of humans to survive at well above sea level is the focus of an article that examines how people in the Himalayas , Andes or Ethiopian Highlands have adapted and even flourish in some of the harshest environments on the planet .</div>
    <div> As a constant and varied part of the air around us , storms can be both thrilling and frightening . In this edition we look at lightning in particular . Even when modern science can explain why thunderbolts form , the power they unleash continues to fill us with awe . In antiquity , the air was associated with no less than Hera , the Queen of the Gods . Her favor secured good weather , and her curse brought storms . In truth , both lifegiving and destructive forces arise in the air around us . Perhaps the ancients were on to something , after all .</div>

    <div> Air 7</div>
    <div> Origins – How Air Has Evolved Since Prehistoric Times How the Air Became What It Is Today : The Basis of Life on Earth</div>
    <div> The Earth was still relatively young , around one-and-a-half billion years ago , when something happened that changed everything . Up to then , the planet had been a hot , stinking , essentially uncomfortable place where no life existed – just primitive bacteria and unicellular organisms that utilized hydrogen or sulfite in order to convert it into energy . This early form of respiration was not especially efficient , however , and the bacteria were consequently condemned to eternal tininess . An atmosphere – and therefore an early form of air – has existed ever since the Earth ’ s mass was stable enough for gravity to keep a lid on the gases released from rock as a result of volcanic activity and thus preventing them from flying off into space .</div>
    <div> This atmosphere was akin to that of Mars and Venus and consisted of steam , hydrogen and carbon monoxide . There was also nitrogen , carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide , which poured from the skies in the form of yellow rain . It was not an ideal combination for us humans . In such an environment , we would have suffocated and been totally unable to survive . That ’ s because people need oxygen . Not too much , but not too little either .</div>
    <div> Oxygen , which is created in outer space when a stellar explosion ( supernova ) occurs , already existed on Earth , says Friedrich Temps , a professor of physical chemistry in Kiel , Germany . “ But it was chemically bonded with the rock .” The world evolved very , very slowly , but steadily . The meteorite and asteroid attacks declined in number . At some point , the Earth was so cool that the rain no longer vaporized . The first rainy season lasted</div>
    <div> 40,000</div>
    <div> years and washed the volcanic ash out of the atmosphere . The Sun broke through , and it became bright . However , the</div>
    <div> UV</div>
    <div> radi ation of the Sun was still too strong . At that time , for instance , all living things would have suffered not only severe sunburn but death . The water – which came not only from the magma emissions but also , it is thought , from water-rich cometary impacts – filled up the oceans , lakes and rivers .</div>
    <div> UV</div>
    <div> radiation is weaker in the oceans and it is precisely there that life began – and with it the emergence of air as we know it today . “ It is certain that traces of oxygen were also created by the reaction of</div>
    <div> UV</div>
    <div> light and water ,” explains Temps . “ But the greatest oxygen concentrations , as we know them today , are a result of life .”</div>
    <div> And this is how it came about : Cyanobacteria , also known as bluegreen algae , are not just tiny but nano-tiny . They settle in shallow seas and in any location where water stands for any length of time . A single droplet of water can contain billions of them , says science writer Gabrielle Walker . For chemists , these unprepossessing beings are sleeping giants . They are the inventors of the process that brought life to Earth : photosynthesis . It is indisputably the most important chemical reaction ever produced in nature . The bacteria</div>
    <div> Books on the Topic :</div>
    <div> Gabrielle Walker : An Ocean of Air . A Natural History of the Atmosphere , 364 pages , Bloomsbury Publishing .</div>
    <div> Reinhard Zellner ( pub .): Chemie über den Wolken : ... und darunter , 238 pages , Wiley-VCH Verlag .</div>
    <div> learned to tap the Sun ’ s energy and produce the nutrient sugar – with the help of carbon dioxide . The complex chemical reaction of photosynthesis yields a waste product : oxygen , which humans and animals need in order to breathe and which today constitutes at least</div>
    <div> 21</div>
    <div> percent of what we call air (</div>
    <div> 78</div>
    <div> percent being nitrogen , which all life forms need for the production of amino acids , as well as other gases such as carbon dioxide and argon ). Though today decried as an “ environmental pollutant ,” the trace gas of carbon dioxide is the other party in an arrangement that made life possible . Carbon dioxide , which humans produce as a waste product , is not just nutrition for plants – as a temperature regulator , it is also responsible for the climate on Earth . “ We are part of a deal that keeps us all alive ,” writes Walker . “ The plants swallow our waste and we swallow theirs . The living , breathing medium for this never-ending exchange is the air .”</div>
    <div> The blue-green algae in the oceans proved to be prolific producers of oxygen . This extremely reactive gas initially bonded mainly with iron- and sulfur-containing rock in the ocean and later on Earth , for many millions of years . Above the ocean , however , more and more oxygen rose into the atmosphere – whose composition the new miracle material fundamentally altered . Most importantly , the oxygen ensured that the ozone layer which formed at a height of</div>
    <div> 50</div>
    <div> kilometers protected living beings and plants from the dangerous</div>
    <div> UV</div>
    <div> radiation of the Sun .</div>
    <div> The first , still primitive forms of life to breathe oxygen finally appeared in the ocean</div>
    <div> 1.5</div>
    <div> billion years ago . No one knows exactly when the first plants , such as fungi , lichen and moss appeared on land . Some scientists believe this actually happened around</div>
    <div> 1.5</div>
    <div> billion years ago . However , the oldest plant fossils ever found on Earth are only about</div>
    <div> 600</div>
    <div> million years old . With the plants that took over photosynthesis from the blue-green algae , however , oxygen production exploded – and with it , evolution . The Earth ’ s green lung got to work .</div>
    <div> The reactive oxygen became a rapid , extremely effective energy producer :</div>
    <div> 650</div>
    <div> million years ago , beings with several cells appeared all at once and continued to diversify further with increasingly complex and bold genetic blueprints : jellyfish , sponges and worms . Another</div>
    <div> 100</div>
    <div> million years later saw the advent of the arthropods – the first rulers of Earth – even before the dinosaurs ( who developed</div>
    <div> 235</div>
    <div> million years ago ). From there , it was only a short jump to the first humans : Homo rudolfensis . They lived approximately</div>
    <div> 2.5</div>
    <div> million years ago .</div>
    <div> Around</div>
    <div> 400</div>
    <div> million years ago , oxygen production by plants and oxygen consumption due to breathing hovered around the equilibrium that determines today ’ s atmosphere . Interference with this equilibrium by humans – for instance through gases that contribute to the greenhouse gas effect , or destroy the ozone layer – has devastating consequences for the climate and biosphere . “ We would do well to take care of the atmosphere and above all the forests ,” says Professor Temps at the end of our discussion . “ That ’ s because they ’ re the guardians of our life .”</div>

    <div> The Himalayas</div>
    <div> Himalaya in the ancient Indian language of Sanskrit means “ abode of snow .” The name could hardly be more appropriate . This mountain range is home to the world ’ s loftiest peaks , covered in thick blankets of snow or encased in eternal ice . Fourteen peaks soar to more than</div>
    <div> 8,000</div>
    <div> meters , over</div>
    <div> 200</div>
    <div> reach over</div>
    <div> 7,000</div>
    <div> meters and there are hundreds more at over 6,000 meters . The range stretches for more than</div>
    <div> 2,500</div>
    <div> kilo meters , from Pakistan in the west to Myanmar in the east . Four other countries – India , Nepal , China ( Tibet ) and Bhutan – also have their share . And it ’ s not just the mountains that are powerful . The valleys that have been carved by the region ’ s mighty rivers are also immense . The Kali Gandaki Gorge , for instance , is more than</div>
    <div> 4,000</div>
    <div> meters deep . More than</div>
    <div> 40</div>
    <div> million people , most of them sub sisting as farmers in areas up to</div>
    <div> 3,000</div>
    <div> meters above sea level , live in the valleys and on the high plateaus . At the higher altitudes the farmers , nuns , monks and yakand sheepherders have adapted – just like the native flora and fauna – to the harsh conditions and the long , snowy winters .</div>
    <div> The yak snorts and tosses its head . Its eyes fixed on a little bit of green at the edge of the field , it stamps through the freshly plowed furrows ; the other half of the team follows willingly . Nima Dorje drops the plow and jumps to his wife ’ s assistance . Through gentle persuasion , they pull together and succeed in getting both animals back on the right furrow . Nima drives the plow into the soil and follows the once-again obedient yaks . His gaze glides over the backs of the animals and then falls on the gigantic surrounding mountains . It seems only minutes since the peaks were bathed in ice-blue light , but now the mountain face is masked by darkening clouds . Though the sun continues to penetrate the valley floor , Nima is all too aware of how capricious the weather can be . Within minutes , tropical humidity can give way to Arctic chill , and hurricane-like storms can disrupt the calm scene . It would be disastrous if the weather were to turn today , as they need to finish plowing the field before winter arrives . There ’ s not much time . Just that morning , they were greeted by ice at the spring . Snow is in the air . Nima and his family live in Nepal ’ s Tsum Valley , a remote place close to the border with Tibet ,</div>

    <div> You have to be patient at more than 3,200 meters above sea level . In the Himalayas the fields are plowed using yaks , the stone houses built and terraced fields planted by hand . In the Tsum Valley with its Tibetan culture , the second-born child of each family is raised in the monastery ; surrounded by the Buddhist community these children are fed and educated . The other children help their parents in the fields and in the kitchen .</div>

    <div> radiation strong and the air almost too thin to breathe . Nevertheless , these mountains are home to millions of people . Even at an altitude of</div>
    <div> 4,500</div>
    <div> meters , they cultivate their fields , meditate in monasteries , raise their children . Their breathing remains relaxed , while lowlanders who reach these heights struggle with a rapid heartbeat and shortness of breath .</div>
    <div> Humans as Imperfect Beings</div>
    <div> “ As imperfect beings , humans quickly reach the limits of their ability and capacity for suffering in the oxygen-starved atmosphere on the world ’ s rooftops – whether in the Alps , the Andes or the Himalayas ,” writes mountaineer Reinhold Messner . “ We humans are not made for living at the same altitude as Mont Blanc – or indeed , at higher altitudes – without special technology or for any length of time .” Unless , that is , we possess special mechanisms for adapting like the Tibetans or Peruvians . But more about that later . We start by finding out what happens to the human body at high altitudes . As distance above sea level increases , the air column pressing on the surface gets smaller and air pressure falls . The oxygen content remains at</div>
    <div> 21</div>
    <div> percent , meaning the partial pressure of oxygen falls in tandem with the drop in barometric pressure . For every meter of altitude , therefore , there are fewer molecules of oxygen available with each breath of air . At</div>
    <div> 4,000</div>
    <div> meters , a breath of air still contains about</div>
    <div> 60</div>
    <div> percent of the oxygen molecules that a human being would enjoy at sea level . At</div>
    <div> 5,500</div>
    <div> meters the figure is around one-half and on Mount Everest it ’ s one-third . At up to</div>
    <div> 2,500</div>
    <div> meters , the human body normally has no problem handling the depleted oxygen level . Above that , or after climbing from a previous altitude to an even higher one , lack of oxygen in the body , a state known as hypoxia , can threaten the body . How grave the consequences are basically depends on the speed of ascent : The faster it occurs , the less opportunity the body has to adapt . There is a risk of acute altitude sickness . The most frequent symptoms include headaches , tiredness , loss of appetite , dizziness , trouble sleeping and vomiting . “ In extreme cases , the changes in the human body brought about by the lack of oxygen &gt;</div>

    <div> an environment that literally takes lowlanders ’ breath away . Yet they suffer no altitude sickness . Their secret lies in a process of adapting over a period of millennia , a process that varies depending on the region . In the case of longer periods at high altitudes , the human body needs to respond appropriately to the lower oxygen content so that it can acclimatize . “ These adjustment processes occur at the various points of oxygen transport , starting with the air we inhale all the way to the tissue ,” says Oelz . “ The best-known is certainly the increase in the ventilation rate and rising concentrations of hemoglobin , which is the oxygen-binding blood pigment .” Improved utilization of oxygen in the cells is also important , as are other adjustment processes . For lowlanders visiting high altitudes , such as migrant workers , mountaineers and trekkers , these acclimatization mechanisms kick in after only a short time . One might assume that people who live in thin air on a permanent basis would rely on similar adaptation strategies . That is not necessarily the case , however , as estimates suggest that the ancestors of the inhabitants of the Tibetan Plateau and the Andes arrived</div>
    <div> 25,000</div>
    <div> and</div>
    <div> 11,000</div>
    <div> years ago respectively . They , just like the Ethiopians , who migrated from the lowlands to the highlands several thousand years ago , had to adapt to the stresses of a lifetime of hypoxia .</div>
    <div> “ Through natural selection , these populations have learned to maintain the successful delivery of oxygen even at high altitude ,” according to</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> anthropologist Cynthia Beall . “ Evolutionary processes have affected the different mountain peoples and their descendants in different ways , as illustrated by the major differences in many physiological traits between inhabitants of the Andes , Tibetans and Ethiopian highlanders .”</div>
    <div> Different Strategies</div>
    <div> One important difference relates to the concentration of hemoglobin . Like the lowlanders who travel to altitudes above</div>
    <div> 2,500</div>
    <div> meters , inhabitants of the Andes also have more hemoglobin in their blood , which offsets the lower concentration of oxygen . The same is not true for Tibetans : Their blood contains an average concentration of hemoglobin even at</div>
    <div> 4,000</div>
    <div> meters , and even at higher altitudes only a relatively small increase occurs . The latest findings suggest these normal values are attributable to special variants of a &gt;</div>

    <div> The Andes</div>
    <div> The Cordillera de los Andes – as the Andes are called in Spanish – are the longest mountain range on earth . They run through South America for a distance of about</div>
    <div> 7,500</div>
    <div> kilometers along the west coast of the continent , from Venezuela in the north to Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , Bolivia and Argentina to the southernmost tip of Chile . Its highest peak is the</div>
    <div> 6,962-meter-high</div>
    <div> Mount Aconcagua in Argentina , although similarly high peaks are found in abundance throughout the region . The Andes are home to an estimated</div>
    <div> 35</div>
    <div> million people , the majority living in regions of between</div>
    <div> 2,000-</div>
    <div> and</div>
    <div> 3,500-</div>
    <div> meter altitudes . Here they cultivate the fertile valleys and terraced slopes for wheat , barley , corn , potatoes and vegetables , in addition to keeping cattle . The regions up to</div>
    <div> 4,000</div>
    <div> meters are more sparsely populated and are primarily used to graze sheep , goats , llamas and alpacas .</div>
    <div> gene – known as</div>
    <div> EPAS1</div>
    <div> or</div>
    <div> HIF2alpa</div>
    <div> , which regulates the response to hypoxia and is therefore at least partially responsible for altitude acclimatization .</div>
    <div> The third significant highland population – the inhabitants of the Ethiopian Highlands plateau – have a normal concentration of hemoglobin similar to that of the Tibetans . “ Interestingly , however , this cannot be explained by the same gene ,” says Beall , who teaches at Case Western University in Cleveland , Ohio , and has researched life at high altitudes for decades . “ Thus far , there seem to be two patterns of hemoglobin response to high-altitude hypoxia : One is a higher concentration of hemoglobin among visitors from the lowlands and inhabitants of the Andes , and second , inhabitants of Tibet and the Ethiopian Highlands show only a small increase in hemoglobin values , or none .” The question of why the typical acclimatization response seen in lowland inhabitants did not occur in the Tibetan or Ethiopian populations has not yet been conclusively answered . A possible explanation might be that this strategy would come at a high price over the long term , for instance , because thickened blood increases the risk of thrombosis .</div>

    <div> meters above sea level . Like many other children in the Andes , Beatrice and César look after their family ’ s livestock in Peru ’ s Cordillera Blanca . The people who live in these mountains depend on their animals – mainly sheep , llamas and alpacas – for meat and wool . Llamas in particular are also used in these remote regions as pack animals .</div>
    <div> Another different adaptation strategy concerns breathing : If ventilation is increased , a greater volume of air can be moved in overall terms , so additional oxygen can be delivered to the body . This response is also shown by lowlanders with acute high-altitude exposure , but is generally only temporary . The Tibetans are different : Their resting ventilation is permanently elevated , as Beall has proven through comparative analysis . Accordingly , a Tibetan has a higher resting ventilation rate of around</div>
    <div> 15</div>
    <div> liters as compared with only</div>
    <div> 10</div>
    <div> for an inhabitant of the Andes . “ One could say that Andeans go the hematological route , Tibetans the respiratory route ,” says Beall , summarizing the two most important differences in altitude adaptation . “ Infant mortality is therefore much more common among Han Chinese who have settled in Tibet than it is among native Tibetans . The former lack the gene that has proved advantageous to mountain dwellers over the course of evolution .” So , the secret behind Nima ’ s ability to survive without headaches , dizziness and rapid heartbeat at more than</div>
    <div> 3,200</div>
    <div> meters is thousands of years old . But that won ’ t make his life any easier : The world ’ s rooftop is still one of the most inhospitable places to live . &lt;</div>
    <div> Ancient Secret</div>
    <div> The findings suggest that the process of acclimatization at altitude – however it may occur – was crystallized and passed down over millennia . Accordingly , lowlanders who migrate to the mountains can only adapt to high altitudes to a certain degree ; problems occur during pregnancy , if not before . “ Even if the mother is acclimatized , her child is not prepared for the high altitude ,” says physician Oelz .</div>

    <div> Heat Lightning – a Fatal Attraction Storms : From the Wrath of the Gods to High Voltage in the Skies</div>
    <div> Humans have always reacted with a mixture of fear and fascination to the primal force of storms and the fury of thunder and lightning . A raging tempest used to be seen as a manifestation of the wrath of the gods . Nowadays we know that lightning is a gigantic electrical discharge – but it can still pose a threat to us . The ancient Babylonians and Greeks believed that the destructive effect of lightning was caused by the gods hurling explosive jets of fire and shattering thunderbolts to earth . Zeus , the supreme overlord of the Greek gods , was the god of weather and he was responsible in particular for rain , snow , hail and storms . His thunderbolts were much-feared weapons that hit home with unfailing accuracy . Zeus also pronounced omens : His sacred oak tree at Dodona in Epirus foretold the future to mortal beings , and thunder and lightning were thought to portend good fortune or adversity . Jupiter , the supreme deity of the Romans , was also responsible for the weather .</div>
    <div> Summer , Season of Storms</div>
    <div> Nowadays we know that lightning is an electrical discharge in the atmosphere that can be highly dangerous to humans and animals . The risk of storms is greater on hot summer days , when isolated heat storms break out as the temperature rises across land masses . Although today we can predict the likelihood of storms for a specific region quite well , even nowadays , it is still very hard to forecast precisely when and where a storm cell will develop . On days like this , the skies can still be radiantly blue in the morning . Within a very short time , however , huge billowing clouds can suddenly materialize to darken the heavens . Anyone who has been caught unawares by a storm during a mountain hike will know just how quickly the weather can change . A storm can blow up very abruptly as lightning begins to flash and thunder starts to roll . Lightning can become a serious threat unless safe shelter is found quickly .</div>
    <div> Solar Energy Generates Storms</div>
    <div> There are several hundred thousand lightning strikes on earth every day . They set fire to forests and homes , claiming the lives of people and animals . About</div>
    <div> 2,000</div>
    <div> thunderstorms are raging somewhere on the planet at any given time . In Switzerland alone , about</div>
    <div> 300,000</div>
    <div> flashes of lightning are recorded each year . As soon &gt;</div>

    <div> 20 Air</div>
    <div> Photos : Andreas Walker</div>
    <div> as the ground warms up during the course of the day , the heated air above it rises and cools down . This process creates the cauliflower-like cumulus clouds that can develop into gigantic thunderclouds . These thunderclouds transform tiny streams into torrents of mud as they shed their entire load of hail and water over a small area . Storm activity increases dramatically when a cold front encounters moist and warm air masses . The incoming cold air originates from northern or even polar latitudes . The cold air ( which has greater specific gravity ) advances , displacing the lighter warm air . There is enormous meteorological activity in the zone where these two very different masses of air meet . Due to the substantial differences in temperature , the thermal energy stored in the water vapor is converted into mechanical energy . The warmer the air , the more moisture and energy it can contain – and this energy is released as the temperature falls . Storm gusts and updrafts carry falling raindrops to great heights , leading to the formation of hail . Strong updrafts ( of up to</div>
    <div> 100</div>
    <div> meters per second in extreme cases ) repeatedly transport hailstones to high altitudes . If the hailstones are small , they may thaw in the warm summer air as they travel downwards , so they usually reach the ground as rainstorms with large drops that are cold to the touch . Very large hailstones only melt partially ; they reach the earth ’ s surface as lumps of ice that often cause major damage to crops and objects of all sorts .</div>
    <div> For a long time , lightning was an unsolved mystery . It was not until electricity was discovered that this strange “ celestial fire ” was explained . Finally , Benjamin Franklin (</div>
    <div> 1706 – 1790</div>
    <div> ) performed an experiment that proved that lightning is an electrical phenomenon . Zones with different electrical charges are created by updrafts and an uneven distribution of ice and water in a storm cloud . The upper , icy part of the cloud usually has a positive charge , whereas in most cases , the lower part is negatively charged . A potential ( or voltage ) is created between the different charges . If a certain value is exceeded , the opposing charges in two zones ( cloud – cloud , cloud – ground or vice versa ) are equalized , and this process produces lightning . When a flash of lightning occurs , currents averaging</div>
    <div> 20 – 30</div>
    <div> million volts and</div>
    <div> 20,000</div>
    <div> amperes flow for fractions of a second ( normal outlet :</div>
    <div> 230</div>
    <div> volts ,</div>
    <div> 10</div>
    <div> amperes ).</div>
    <div> What Causes Drawn-out Rolls of Thunder ?</div>
    <div> This tremendous energy abruptly heats the air surrounding the lightning to about</div>
    <div> 30,000</div>
    <div> degrees Celsius ( and this temperature also explains the bluish color of the flash ). As heating takes place , the air expands explosively and a loud thunderclap is heard . The speed of sound is “ only ”</div>
    <div> 330</div>
    <div> meters per second , whereas the light from the lightning travels at</div>
    <div> 300,000</div>

    <div> be calculated from the time that elapses between the lightning and the thunder . The distance in kilometers is one-third of the number of seconds between the lightning flash and the thunderclap . A flash of lightning can be several kilometers long , so the sound from its more distant ( upper ) parts reaches a given point later than that from the near ( lower ) part . This is what causes a drawn-out roll of thunder .</div>
    <div> Stay Away From Oak Trees</div>
    <div> In Florida , people say that you are more likely to be struck by lightning than to win the lottery . Although such accidents are relatively unlikely , their victims either die or often suffer the ill effects of the lightning strike long afterwards . Being struck by lightning has a catastrophic effect on the human body , because it is often followed by respiratory failure and cardiac arrest . This makes it all the more amazing that many people survive a lightning strike .</div>
    <div> Lightning always follows the path of least electrical resistance . Since air is an excellent insulator , lightning tends to strike tall objects that conduct electricity well , such as metal masts and trees . The German proverb , “ Stay away from oak trees and seek beech trees ,” reflects a potentially fatal misconception . Lightning penetrates the sap tissue of an oak tree and exits from the tree bark or even parts of the trunk with a spectacular flash . On the other hand , a beech tree can withstand a lightning strike undamaged because it conducts the lightning directly into the ground . This creates the impression that beech trees are spared by lightning . During a storm , it is generally advisable to avoid any freestanding tall objects . Swimming or surfing near a storm is particularly dangerous . The surface of the water and the underside of the storm cloud behave like a capacitor . Any object ( such as the mast of a boat or a swimmer ' s head ) that protrudes from the water will lower the resistance and increase the risk that the charge between the cloud and the ground will equalize at that point . It ’ s best to seek cover in a building , a car , or a hollow in the ground .</div>
    <div> The metal body of a car forms what is known as a Faraday cage , which diverts the lightning away to the surrounding area and ensures that anyone inside it is protected in case of a strike . An area deep within a forest surrounded by trees of the same height can also afford protection . Preference should be given to drier areas . If none of these options for protection are available – as often happens , especially in mountainous areas – it is essential not to stay on a summit , crest or ridge or to lean against rock walls .</div>
    <div> If no cover is available and you are forced to remain in the open air , you should adopt a crouching position and never lie flat on the ground . The larger the area of contact , the greater the danger from the impact of lightning can be .</div>

    <div> The aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis seems to pose unprecedented new dilemmas : how inflationary is quantitative easing , how should investors balance short-term deflationary with potential long-term inflationary risks , how should currency exposure be steered ? While current events may appear diffe rent from the past , there are nevertheless always lessons to be learned from what went before , especially when we look back across the diverse experience of multiple decades and many countries . With their analysis of data over 112 years of history and across 19 countries , Elroy Dimson , Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton from the London Business School provide important findings in this year ’ s Credit Suisse Global Investment Returns Yearbook 2012 in respect of the above questions . In another article , Paul McGinnie and Jonathan Wilmot from Credit Suisse Investment Banking show with more than a decade of history how the contrarian indicator they built – the Credit Suisse Global Risk Appetite Index – helps investors to time risk-on versus risk-off investment strategies .</div>

    <div> In today ’ s volatile markets , the benefits of a well-diversified portfolio are more important than ever . Diversification can be achieved by spreading risk across various asset classes , which can improve the risk / return of an investor ’ s overall portfolio . It is in this context of risk diversification that Alternative Investments (</div>
    <div> AI</div>
    <div> ) have become a core Component in most modern portfolio strategies . In an interview with Giles Keating , Head of Private Banking Research , and David Strebel , Head of Investment Advisory &amp; Strategies within Private Banking Investment Services and Products , we consider how to diversify smartly .</div>
    <div> Interview : Kathleen Karius</div>
    <div> Why is now the time for investors to</div>
    <div> increase their allocation in</div>
    <div> AI</div>
    <div> or enter</div>
    <div> into the space altogether ?</div>
    <div> Giles Keating : Historically ,</div>
    <div> AI</div>
    <div> has proven to be a good diversifier within a traditional portfolio of stocks and bonds . Our</div>
    <div> AI</div>
    <div> benchmark portfolio had a correlation of only about</div>
    <div> 0.6</div>
    <div> to equities over the last</div>
    <div> 17</div>
    <div> years , and of course , financial theory suggests that introducing low-correlation assets into a portfolio usually reduces volatility at any given level of expected return , or improves expected return while maintaining volatility .</div>
    <div> That low correlation is especially helpful in an environment like the current one where uncertainties around equities and bonds seem high , whether we look at the Eurozone issues , the debt overhang , or geopolitical threats to oil supply .</div>
    <div> And at times of market stress ,</div>
    <div> AI</div>
    <div> can help to reduce drawdowns . For example , while the S &amp;</div>
    <div> P 500</div>
    <div> Index lost</div>
    <div> 7.7</div>
    <div> percent in July and August</div>
    <div> 2011</div>
    <div> , and the</div>
    <div> MSCI</div>
    <div> World Equity Index fell</div>
    <div> 9.0</div>
    <div> percent , the Credit Suisse Investable Hedge Fund Index lost</div>
    <div> 2.9</div>
    <div> percent . Moreover , an investor following our recommendation at the time to focus on the global macro style within the hedge fund universe could have seen gains of</div>
    <div> 2.5</div>
    <div> percent across those two months based on the Investable Credit Suisse AllHedge Index for hedge funds of that style .</div>
    <div> Within a diversified portfolio , these hedge fund moves would have mitigated the impact of the equity losses . The same characteristics generally hold true for other alternative assets , including gold .</div>
    <div> What is Credit Suisse recommending</div>
    <div> specifically in terms of</div>
    <div> AI</div>
    <div> allocation ?</div>
    <div> David Strebel : Due to their valuable properties ,</div>
    <div> AI</div>
    <div> should be part of any investor ’ s asset allocation considerations , because of the benefits Giles already mentioned : diversification , drawdown protection and return potential . It is therefore natural that</div>
    <div> AI</div>
    <div> plays a prominent role in the Credit Suisse asset allocation framework .</div>
    <div> Currently , within our optimal long-term oriented benchmark asset allocation , we recommend a</div>
    <div> 15</div>
    <div> percent total holding of</div>
    <div> AI</div>
    <div> for our fixed income and equity strategies , and</div>
    <div> 20</div>
    <div> percent for our income oriented , balanced and capital gains oriented strategies . To assure sufficient diversification within the asset category , we generally suggest an equal split into hedge funds , private equity , real estate and commodities / gold . For clients investing less than five million Swiss francs or its equivalent , or those with a limited ability to bear liquidity risk , private equity investments should be substituted with hedge funds .</div>
    <div> In order to preserve its clear focus , our equity strategy does not comprise real estate</div>
    <graphic image="I50" x="228.60" y="43.70" width="57.61" height="60.50"/>
    <div> “ It is natural that</div>
    <div> AI</div>
    <div> play a prominent role in the asset allocation framework .”</div>
    <div> David Strebel</div>
    <div> investments and fixed income strategy investors should abstain from private equity exposure . It goes without saying that the client ’ s personal asset allocation has to reflect his or her investment objectives , the risk profile and the overall wealth situation . This is why a professional advice is so important .</div>
    <div> David , you spoke about the long term ;</div>
    <div> where do we stand in the next six months</div>
    <div> to a year ?</div>
    <div> David Strebel : Considering our medium-term market outlook , we currently overweight equities and also</div>
    <div> AI</div>
    <div> in the strategic asset allocation . Within the latter , we overweight real estate and gold , for which we see an attractive return potential over the next</div>
    <div> 6</div>
    <div> –</div>
    <div> 12</div>
    <div> months .</div>
    <div> Some investors are worried about entering or re-entering into</div>
    <div> AI</div>
    <div> . How did the</div>
    <div> last market crisis impact the</div>
    <div> AI</div>
    <div> Space ?</div>
    <div> Giles Keating :</div>
    <div> AI</div>
    <div> are neither a safe haven , nor are they risk free . The financial market environment last year proved challenging for a number of reasons and this affected</div>
    <div> AI</div>
    <div> , too .</div>
    <div> 2011</div>
    <div> was not only a period of slowing economic growth , there were also problems in the banking system ; even sovereign borrowers had liquidity and solvency problems .</div>
    <div> However , despite this difficult period ,</div>
    <div> AI</div>
    <div> proved a valuable addition to traditional</div>
    <div> portfolios .</div>
    <div> Giles Keating : Yes , provided a careful choice was made . For instance , real estate generated yields hard to achieve elsewhere . And although some of the broad commodity indexes had a rocky ride in</div>
    <div> 2011</div>
    <div> , investors who augmented a conventional stock and bond portfolio with exposure to commodities based on momentum strategies , which was our recommendation at the time , would have had the opportunity for a significant improvement in portfolio performance .</div>
    <div> In addition as many people know , gold was one of the very few risky assets with decent positive returns . And on the hedge fund side , less liquidity-sensitive strategies , such as global macro , exhibited strong performance .</div>
    <div> So , while</div>
    <div> AI</div>
    <div> is not immune to challenging market conditions , it has a tendency to react differently to these challenges compared to traditional asset categories . As a result , the inclusion of</div>
    <div> AI</div>
    <div> tends to improve the overall risk / return trade-off of investment portfolios . Essentially , this is what investing in</div>
    <div> AI</div>
    <div> is all about and during challenging market conditions this is particularly valuable . But choice of the right strategies and instruments is crucial . &gt;</div>

    <div> which is a clear change from the momentum strategies we favored in</div>
    <div> 2011</div>
    <div> . Right now , value strategies would favor copper and some other industrial metals , which came under severe selling pressure due to deleveraging and macro concerns in the second half of last year and now even after a modest rally , appear attractively valued .</div>
    <div> Gold is likely to also do well in a lowinterest rate environment , but the upside is more limited . And as a hedging strategy against geopolitical instability in the Middle East , we propose buying out of the money oil calls .</div>

    <div heading="article"> Urban Magnetism</div>
    <div> For decades , cities have attracted people in search of opportunity . From São Paulo to Shanghai , their ability to connect talent , resources and ideas has caused urban areas to prosper .</div>
    <div> In Manhattan , the average wage in</div>
    <div> 2010</div>
    <div> was</div>
    <div> 45</div>
    <div> percent higher than in Silicon Valley , and</div>
    <div> 170</div>
    <div> percent above the</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> average . In his book “ Triumph of the City ,” economist Edward Glaeser asserts that cities are hubs of productivity and innovation , fueled by competition for talent as they allow for social and economic mobility . In essence , cities are all about relationships and opportunities , or in the words of Harvard ’ s Rosabeth Moss Kanter , cities appear to be “ one big dating game .”</div>
    <div> Between Prosperity and Urban Divide</div>
    <div> The urbanization trend is most evident in emerging markets : Over the next</div>
    <div> 10</div>
    <div> years , per capita income is set to nearly double throughout major cities in Africa and Asia . Between</div>
    <div> 2010</div>
    <div> and</div>
    <div> 2020</div>
    <div> , Shanghai ’ s</div>
    <div> GDP</div>
    <div> will grow by the same amount as Tokyo ’ s in absolute terms , while Mumbai ’ s will exceed that of Hong Kong . However , the rise of the urban consumer also opens a chasm between haves and have-nots : While over</div>
    <div> 200</div>
    <div> million people have been lifted out of slums over the last</div>
    <div> 10</div>
    <div> years , the number of new slum dwellers increases by</div>
    <div> 6</div>
    <div> million every year , according to a report from the United Nations . For instance , Angola ’ s capi tal Luanda is growing at a staggering</div>
    <div> 4</div>
    <div> percent per year , fueled by large-scale oil and infrastructure projects , but two-thirds of the city ’ s inhabitants live in poverty . Beyond prosperity , the urban divide manifests itself in environmental degradation , income inequality and exclusion .</div>

    <div> Historically , there has been a fine line separating urban success from demise . What , for instance , caused Peru , the center of the wealthy Inca civilization in the</div>
    <div> 15th</div>
    <div> century , to fall behind the United States so dramatically in terms of per capita income ? While urbanization</div>
    <div> 600</div>
    <div> years ago is indeed negatively correlated with</div>
    <div> GDP</div>
    <div> per capita today , the reversal of fortune is rather explained by colonial institutions than attributable to urban demise . In their seminal work on institutions and economic growth , Daron Acemoglu , Simon Johnson and James Robinson forcefully argued that while colonial powers introduced property rights and room for alternative policies in sparsely settled areas , they deprived urban societies of their ability to renew by creating extractive institutions that left wealth in the hands of a small elite . Then and now , institutions matter . Today , metropolitan governance that safeguards access to opportunity while mitigating environmental and social risks will likely be the cornerstone of urban success .</div>
    <div> Implications for Business Models</div>
    <div> Today , urbanization is not simply about the expansion of an urban jungle ; it is about transformation . Municipal governments are judged against their ability to provide efficient transport , manage health care and prevent crime . Cities are expected to provide highquality recreational areas , clean air and affordable housing . This inevitably creates a wide range of opportunities for the private sector , including efficient transportation , waste management , environmental solutions and information and communication technology to manage flows of people and goods . Their biggest asset , however , will be their ability to connect resources and talent .</div>

    <div> The current dilapidated state of infrastructure in the developed countries as well as the rising demand for infrastructure in emerging economies suggests increasing capital needs . Coming at a time when traditional sources of funding are limited , this opens up opportunities for investors .</div>
    <div> Photo : Credit Suisse</div>
    <div> All countries – no matter how big or small – will face many new trends during the next several decades . Factors such as changing regulations , renewable resources , customer demands , infrastructure and finance , technology and training , and even “ better practices ” will provide challenges going forward . Anticipating these megatrends and preparing strategies to deal with them will be more productive and sustainable in the near term .</div>
    <div> In today ’ s world where everything is changing fast , countries in general must learn to adapt for the new future . The</div>
    <div> 2008</div>
    <div> financial crisis resulted in a “ new normal ” environment of persistently high unemployment , increasing regulation and low interest rates in many developed countries . In addition , whispers of moderating emerging market growth have become louder given a backdrop of economic , political and even social uncertainty . While one cannot foresee how global growth will continue , one industry has proven to be everlasting during all economic periods historically : infrastructure .</div>
    <div> Characteristics of Infrastructure</div>
    <div> There are various definitions of what constitutes infrastructure , but generally infrastructure refers to the large-scale public systems , services and facilities of a country or region that are necessary for the proper functioning of global economies . These include transportation , communication systems , water , energy production , energy distribution , waste management and public institutions , such as schools , post offices and prisons . Infrastructure assets are generally characterized by high development costs – due to high barriers to entry – and are generally managed and financed on a long-term basis . The asset</div>

    <div> “ Global growth and urbanization are creating demand for more infrastructure .”</div>
    <div> Yogi Thambiah</div>
    <div> class is typically divided into two major groupings : economic ( transport , communications , energy and utilities ) and social ( for example stadiums or health care facilities ).</div>
    <div> Role of Government Questioned</div>
    <div> Historically , it was seen as the role of the government to fund and manage these assets for the good of the population . Today , this role is increasingly being questioned both in terms of the absolute cost to taxpayers and as to whether a government can deliver the assets as efficiently as a private company competing for the privilege . From the government ’ s perspective there is a strong case for privatization , where the debt raised by the private partner remains on their balance sheets , not on that of the Treasury ’ s . These factors have resulted in a gradual migration from the public provision of infrastructure to the private sector . The private provision of these assets may take many forms from joint ventures , concessions and franchises through to straight delivery contracts . Essentially the private sector is being brought in to design , build , finance and maintain public sector assets in return for long-term contracted payments from the government or access to the revenues generated from the asset .</div>
    <div> Within the broader economic and social categories , infrastructure is often classified depending on its stage of development . From this perspective , infrastructure is tradi tionally seen as “ greenfield ” or “ brownfield ” assets . Sometimes referred to as “ growth infrastructure ,” greenfield investments refer to new facilities that require design , financing , building and operating . Brownfield investments essentially refer to existing , aging assets that require rehabilitation and are sometimes referred to as “ mature infrastructure .” Geographically , greenfield infrastructure investments are more prevalent in emerging markets , while brownfield assets are more characteristic of developed markets .</div>
    <div> One of the key characteristics of infrastructure assets , and what can make them particularly attractive as investments , is that they tend to be , or exhibit the characteristics of , natural monopolies . Infrastructure assets tend to be subject to varying degrees of government regulation , depending largely on the degree of natural monopoly . This is not necessarily to the detriment of investors in infrastructure , as it provides a level of surety regarding the income streams that will likely flow from the asset . Regulation governing revenues of many global infrastructure businesses tend to have embedded pricing formulas allowing these companies to raise the prices of their services according to the path of inflation . That factor – combined with a captive customer base ��� tends to make the cash-flow streams of many infrastructure assets relatively insulated from the ups and downs of the economic cycle .</div>

    <div> infrastructure and all forms of energy . Increasing regulations , continued growth in communities and the evolution of consumer attitudes in terms of trust and confidence , mean there is tremendous need for infrastructure investment . Aging facilities are in need of repair , while growing populations are also straining existing system capacities . Drainage management and watershed management are also becoming more critical and the required infrastructure investments are extremely large as a result . Though investment estimates vary widely , even the lowest numbers are staggering , as coalitions within the industry try to develop a sense of urgency to act on the growing needs .</div>
    <div> Analysts are convinced that there is strong demand for infrastructure based on both secular and cyclical trends . From a secular perspective , they believe that infrastructure investment overall has not kept pace with economic growth . As a result , they expect urbanization and modernization to be the main global infrastructure drivers . The American Society of Civil Engineers , for example , estimates that roughly</div>

    <div> infrastructure system alone over the next five years .</div>
    <div> Further , analysts expect that world governments have relatively limited resources – especially after the Great Recession – and restricted ability to raise both debt and taxes . They believe that this situation is likely to continue for some time , as they do not expect recent government stimulus packages to be enough to fill the global infrastructure financing needs . Further , burgeoning govern ment deficits may spur privatization as governments sell assets to cover budget shortfalls .</div>
    <div> In this light , it is argued that the growing demand created by expected capital needs – vis-à-vis the expected limited public capital – opens an attractive window of opportunity for private investors contemplating infrastruc ture .</div>
    <div> Certain sectors are more attractive in different geographies largely because governments vary widely in their attitudes towards privatization . In the</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> , power generation is generally privately held while public transportation is in the hands of the state . In Europe the opposite is true . Privatization of energy assets is beginning to take place in Europe , while first steps have been taken in the</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> to privatize certain transportation assets with mixed results so far .</div>

    <div> The current dilapidated state of global infrastructure suggests an increasing need for investment as a result of decades of underinvestment in developed economies , as well as economic growth , rising standards of living and the need for infrastructure improvement and development in emerging economies . This demand for capital is occurring at a time when traditional sources of funding for infrastructure investments are limited . Many of the public and private sector sources of capital that have historically funded infrastructure investment are either unwilling or unable to satisfy the need for new investments . These dynamics will continue to compel governments to privatize existing infrastructure assets . Given the current economic volatility , political tension and high unemployment plaguing the global economy , infrastructure can offer opportunity , expansion and growth during these times of uncertainty .</div>

    <div> Change is afoot in the world of business aviation : Alongside the key market of the US , the emerging markets are becoming increasingly significant . Here , Credit Suisse has established itself as the market leader . The Corporate Jet Investor 2012 Award for “ Best private bank for business jet finance and advisory ” testifies to the outstanding competence of Credit Suisse specialists – in particular the high regard in which they are held by clients .</div>

    <div> o fly like a bird has been a dream for humankind since time immemorial . Evidence suggests that the glider – the first man-made flying machine – was designed in China back in the fifth century B . C . In</div>
    <div> 1505</div>
    <div> , universal genius Leonardo da Vinci drew ornithopters , helicopters and parachutes . He was well ahead of his time , though . Two hundred years ago , the famous tailor of Ulm became a laughing stock when his glider crashed into the Danube ; only recently did we discover that his flying machine had actually been airworthy in principle . Another hundred years were to pass , however , before aviation took a decisive step forward : The Wright brothers achieved the first controlled , powered and sustained flight (</div>
    <div> 1903</div>
    <div> ), Louis Blériot</div>
    <div> EBACE in Geneva Is Highpoint of the Year</div>
    <div> crossed the English Channel (</div>
    <div> 1909</div>
    <div> ), while Louis Béchereau developed a streamlined fuselage – the Deperdussin Monocoque – that allowed a doubling of airspeed to</div>
    <div> 204</div>
    <div> kilometers per hour (</div>
    <div> 1912</div>
    <div> /</div>
    <div> 1913</div>
    <div> ).</div>
    <div> We have been aware not only of the importance of technical developments but also of safety measures ever since Icarus , whose wings were made by his father Daedalus using wax and bird ’ s feathers and melted when he flew too close to the sun . While at a later date the early pioneers of flight all too often paid for their courage with their lives , Igor Ivanovich Sikorsky in</div>
    <div> 1913</div>
    <div> built the first large aircraft that was able to continue flying safely and in a stable manner even when one or two of its engines had failed . Today ’ s aircraft</div>
    <div> Around half a dozen specialist trade fairs of key importance to business aviation are</div>
    <div> held worldwide . A number of Credit Suisse staff attend most of them , while at</div>
    <div> EBACE ( European Business Aviation Convention &amp; Exhibition ), held in Geneva from</div>
    <div> May 14 to 16 , Credit Suisse will even have its own stand . EBACE is the second largest</div>
    <div> international trade fair after the NBAA in the US with around 500 exhibitors , more</div>
    <div> than 60 aircraft and over 12,000 visitors , including both manu facturers and industry</div>
    <div> specialists – as well as interested buyers . This fair presents excellent opportunities ,</div>
    <div> not least because the Basel region surrounding EuroAirport has developed into a</div>
    <div> leading center for the interior outfitting of business jets .</div>
    <div> are among the safest forms of transportation – especially in the business aviation sector . The statistics show that business jets suffer around</div>
    <div> 0.07</div>
    <div> accidents per</div>
    <div> 100,000</div>
    <div> flying hours . But safety is also a concern in financial terms given that large jets can easily cost</div>
    <div> 40</div>
    <div> to</div>
    <div> 50</div>
    <div> million dollars , even in standard specification .</div>
    <div> Although the development of aviation is an international affair , business flying has its origins in the</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> . “ Prior to the global financial market crisis , around</div>
    <div> 1,000</div>
    <div> business jets were manufactured in the peak years of</div>
    <div> 2007</div>
    <div> and</div>
    <div> 2008</div>
    <div> ,” explains Michael Rentsch , Head of Credit Suisse Aviation Finance . “ Approximately three-quarters were sold to the</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> and the remainder to other countries .” Accordingly , the</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> is the world ’ s biggest and most important market for business jets – yet Credit Suisse decided against the</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> market when , in</div>
    <div> 1998</div>
    <div> , with</div>
    <div> 50</div>
    <div> or so years ’ experience in ship finance under its belt , it also moved into aviation finance . “ We believed the smaller markets offered greater opportunities , and were proved correct ,” Rentsch recalls . On the one hand , the</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> market share of new deliveries has fallen continuously and currently stands at around</div>
    <div> 60</div>
    <div> percent ; on the other , Credit Suisse has positioned itself as one of the most important players in the other regions . In this regard , he points to Europe as well as the</div>
    <div> BRIC</div>
    <div> countries and other emerging markets . Asia too is becoming a significant region , as is the case in other industries .</div>
    <div> Corporate Jet as an Investment</div>
    <div> “ The development of business aviation mirrors the economic situation in general ,” explains Michael Rentsch . “ Big businesses have been built up by the new , dynamic generation of entrepreneurs in the emerging-market countries . The distances involved in Russia or Asia are normally considerably greater than those in Western Europe and the service provided by the main scheduled airlines is often fairly limited . Those who do not wish to lose valuable time on business trips are dependent on their own corporate jet .” The private or corporate jet is a business investment ; the days when they were seen as little more than expensive luxury toys are behind us . “ It ’ s a fine line , however : On the one hand , entrepreneurs and top executives spend a lot of time on planes , with the result that they attach importance to the right interior outfitting , including state-of-the-art technology and are also emotionally attached to their aircraft ; on the other , the private jet is sometimes</div>

    <div> What may sound simple to the person on the street is in actual fact a scarcely impenetrable set of rules and regulations . Getting an aircraft off the ground takes more than just a successful purchase transaction . The</div>
    <div> 20-strong</div>
    <div> Aviation Finance team includes not only finance specialists but also pilots , engineers and lawyers . The contract documents can easily fill two standard folders , and clients really appreciate it when the financial specialist reads through it all and explains it to them . “ For us , therefore , the two industry awards that we won in February are above all an important confirmation of our efforts because they are based to a considerable extent on feedback from key members of the industry and sector ,” says a delighted Michael Rentsch . “ Clearly , it ’ s not just our clients but also the industry professionals who are very pleased with our services .”</div>
    <div> Rentsch also makes reference to the inaugural Corporate Jet Investor Awards , which were presented in London in February</div>
    <div> 2012</div>
    <div> . Credit Suisse won the award for “ Best Pri vate Bank for Business Jet Finance and Advisory ” – one of the most important catego ries – and was also crowned “ European Business Jet Financier</div>
    <div> 2012</div>
    <div> .” The activities in Russia were probably the make-or-break factor as far as the latter award is concerned . The bank also received three “ honorable recommendations ,” which , in light of its decision to opt out of the</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> market , should also be regarded as an impressive seal of quality .</div>

    <div heading="article"> Look to the Skies : Asia ’ s Airports Are Booming</div>
    <div> For proof that Asia ’ s economies are booming , look to the skies . Bangkok ’ s new airport , for example , is already operating over capacity and traffic demand is set to increase by more than seven percent annually until 2030.</div>
    <div> Terrence Murray , Research Analysis and Policy</div>
    <div> Asia is quickly becoming one of the world ’ s largest aviation markets , and the growth of air traffic in the region is fueling a construction boom as many Asian countries scramble to expand their infrastructure in the face of an increasing number of passengers . Last year alone Jakarta ’ s Soekarno-Hatta International Airport , Guangzhou ’ s Baiyun In ter national Airport and Shanghai ’ s Pudong International Airport all landed on the Airports Council International (</div>
    <div> AIC</div>
    <div> ) list of the world ’ s</div>
    <div> 20</div>
    <div> busiest airports . Growth has been especially robust in China ; in</div>
    <div> 2010</div>
    <div> , Baiyun International tallied a</div>
    <div> 10.6</div>
    <div> percent increase in passenger traffic over the previous year and Pudong saw its own traffic rise by</div>
    <div> 26.4</div>
    <div> percent .</div>
    <div> Overcoming Overburdened Airports</div>
    <div> All the new flyers are straining local air networks , and authorities in the region are increasingly worried about problems like chronic delays and poor customer service . Concerned that overburdened airports could take a bite out of economic growth , many countries in the region have been busy spending money building new facilities and expanding existing ones .</div>
    <div> Tourist-dependent Thailand is a prime example . Last decade the kingdom invested more than</div>
    <div> 4</div>
    <div> billion</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> dollars in Bangkok ’ s ultra-modern Suvarnabhumi Airport . Officially opened in</div>
    <div> 2008</div>
    <div> , Suvarnabhumi can process</div>
    <div> 45</div>
    <div> million passengers annually . However , Thailand is far from the only Asian economy to significantly expand its airport capacity in recent years . Over the last</div>
    <div> 10</div>
    <div> years Hong Kong , Beijing , Tokyo and Shanghai have all either added new terminals or built entirely new airports . While these projects are often a source of local pride , the facilities themselves are often a major economic driver according to Sam Lee , Credit Suisse ’ s Head of Asian Transportation Research in Hong Kong .</div>
    <div> “ It was estimated that in Hong Kong , for example , the value added from the aviation industry represents</div>
    <div> 8.2</div>
    <div> percent of the city ’ s gross domestic product , and the industry directly and indirectly employs more than</div>
    <div> 7</div>
    <div> percent of the working population ,” said Lee .</div>
    <div> Regional Competition Heats Up</div>
    <div> The building boom seems likely to continue across Asia . South Korea recently green-lit a</div>
    <div> 4</div>
    <div> billion</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> dollar expansion of Seoul ’ s Incheon International Airport , a mere</div>
    <div> 10</div>
    <div> years after the airport first opened for business . Today , Incheon is Asia ’ s eighth busiest hub , handling about</div>
    <div> 33</div>
    <div> million passengers annually . Authorities estimate that the expanded airport will eventually process</div>
    <div> 62</div>
    <div> million passengers and</div>
    <div> 5.8</div>
    <div> million tons of cargo a year . As airports expand , regional competition is heating up . Secondary gateways like Incheon or Beijing ’ s Capital International Airport are hoping to become hubs that can take away passengers and cargo from major players like Hong Kong and Singapore , which are currently the region ’ s dominant airports . “ Of all these airports , we don ’ t know who ’ s going to win ,” said Lee . “ Right now they are adding capacity because they are dealing with growing passenger traffic , but they also see huge benefits in attracting more passengers and cargoes to use their facilities either as a final destination , or regional transportation hub .”</div>
    <div> Like their more industrialized counterparts , Asia ’ s emerging economies are also dealing with a record influx of traffic . In the Philippines , more than</div>
    <div> 27</div>
    <div> million passengers travelled through Manila ’ s Ninoy Aquino International Airport in</div>
    <div> 2010</div>
    <div> , up</div>
    <div> 13.3</div>
    <div> percent from the year before . In Vietnam more than</div>
    <div> 9.5</div>
    <div> million passengers used Hanoi ’ s Noi Bai International Airport in</div>
    <div> 2010</div>
    <div> , up</div>
    <div> 21.5</div>
    <div> percent year over year . To ease overcrowding Vietnam broke ground on a</div>
    <div> 961</div>
    <div> million</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> dollar terminal at Noi Bai earlier this year . The new terminal is slated to begin commercial operation in</div>
    <div> 2014</div>
    <div> .</div>
    <div> A</div>
    <div> Cautionary Tale</div>
    <div> Manila represents a cautionary tale for countries that hesitate to expand their infrastructure . Overcrowding has damaged Ninoy Aquino ’ s international reputation , with the influential travel website sleepinginairports . net calling the airport one of the world ’ s worst . While there are no plans to build a new terminal or airport in Manila , there has been talk of transferring some traffic to Clark Air Base , a former</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> Air Force facility northwest of Manila .</div>
    <div> The trade publication Orient Aviation calculates that Asia is poised to invest roughly</div>
    <div> 109</div>
    <div> billion</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> dollars over the next decade to expand and modernize its airport infrastructure . China alone has committed</div>
    <div> 58</div>
    <div> billion</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> dollars to modernize its airports , including the construction of a second facility in Beijing . The expansion of infrastructure represents both a formidable challenge for Asian economies and a potential opportunity for lenders . The region ’ s economies must expand their airports if they want to continue their impressive growth rates , but they will also be searching for ways to finance their ambitious expansion plans .</div>

    <div> The collection of works by contemporary Switzerland-based artists expands to its first international location at the Credit Suisse ’ s Guernsey offices .</div>

    <div> Contemporary Swiss art in Guernsey : Kaspar Müller , Yellow Rope , 2011 , and Pattern 1 + 2 , oil pen on paper , 2008.</div>
    <div> Credit Suisse began collecting contemporary art from Switzerland in</div>
    <div> 1975. Today the</div>
    <div> col lection comprises over</div>
    <div> 5,000</div>
    <div> pieces . The Guernsey office will be the first location outside of Switzerland to receive artwork from the collection on loan . The bank ’ s offices at Helvetia Court in Guernsey are currently undergoing a major refurbishment , due to be completed in</div>
    <div> 2013. One part of the renovation</div>
    <div> already finished in October</div>
    <div> 2011</div>
    <div> included keeping many original features , such as wood paneling , while adding modernizations and making the facilities considerably more energy efficient .</div>
    <div> The area previously displayed art depicting some more traditional Swiss scenes . But after the rooms took on a new , more modern look , it was decided that a new approach was in order . Credit Suisse Collection curator André Rogger visited the offices in October to get a look at the spaces that were available . He returned again in early January</div>
    <div> 2012</div>
    <div> to oversee the installation and hanging of art in meeting rooms and common areas . Among the two dozen paintings , photographs and sculptures that were selected for the Guernsey premises , Kaspar Müller ’ s Yellow Rope seems to best match the local nautical spirit : it is made of coarse rope coiled up to form a kind of basket and then dipped in bright yellow paint so that nothing remains of the rough surface texture of the original .</div>
    <div> The yellow paint seals the rope inside a thick , smooth skin , which has the effect of dematerializing it . Thus a banal object of everyday use is elevated into the realm of art . Yet even there , it remains caught between two worlds , for Yellow Rope is neither readymade , nor is it a sculpture or an assemblage . Rather , it defines a place in art created by Müller himself . “ Art is always about selfassertion ,” says the artist , whose own output proves the point . His interest in slipping his works below the radar of discourse and in creating alien things or situations which defy categorization is always clearly apparent . In Müller ’ s works , their self-assertion alone is sufficient to lend them poignancy .</div>
    <div> Country Head of Credit Suisse in the Channel Islands , Roy McGregor , said that the art had created a talking point among staff , with clients and other visitors . “ The first impression that our clients and prospects have of us is a vital part of the overall welcome experience . The art provides a link to our Swiss parent and makes a bold statement between the old and the new .” The Credit Suisse Collection is an anthology of contemporary art from Switzerland that holds and showcases a cross-section of the art being created in all parts of the country . The opportunity to display parts of the collection abroad reflects the bank ’ s international approach . ı</div>

    <div> Sydney Symphony Fellow Neil Thompson says , “ there ’ s plenty that can ’ t be taught at university .” In fact , only a handful – the best of the best – will succeed in entering the profession . “ The Fellowship gives me the chance to ask the professionals every question</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> can think of . Even though I ’ ve worked with a few of the symphony orchestras , that ’ s not really the time or place to be asking . But I ’ m sure the Sydney Symphony musicians will be anticipating my questions .”</div>

    <div> 11th</div>
    <div> year , the Sydney Symphony Fellowship , proudly supported by Credit Suisse , is a world leader in orchestral training and forms part of the orchestra ’ s award-winning Education Program . Intense training and mentoring allows the Fellows develop their skills in orchestral technique , musicianship and chamber music , gaining firsthand experience of life as a professional musician .</div>
    <div> Gaining Orchestral Experience</div>
    <div> A</div>
    <div> Rising Star The world of conducting has opened its doors to Nicholas Carter , the Sydney Symphony ’ s first-ever Associate Conductor .</div>
    <div> “ Thanks for coming back .” Nicholas Carter ’ s selfdeprecating sense of humor is immediately apparent . He ’ s just thanked the musicians of the Sydney Symphony for not disappearing from rehearsal after their coffee break – the suggestion being that they might have somehow taken umbrage and voted with their feet against the 25-year-old conductor .</div>
    <div> No chance . In 2011 , the Sydney Symphony had so much faith in the young maestro that he was appointed the orchestra ’ s Associate Conductor , the first time such a role has been offered . Carter has since conducted the Sydney Symphony several times on the main stage – the platform of the Sydney Opera House Concert Hall .</div>
    <div> At only 25 years of age , Carter says one of the biggest challenges is gaining the respect of a team of older , more experienced musicians . “ To conduct an orchestra requires an enormous amount of authority . As a young conductor , to do that without coming across as arrogant is a difficult line to walk . It ’ s important to accept that you have much to learn , but still do the job as well as someone who is older than you .”</div>

    <div> The Fellows come from all over Australia . “ Growing up in Emerald</div>
    <div> ( Queensland ), I</div>
    <div> hadn ’ t even heard a French horn until</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> went to university ,” says Sharn McIver . “ But</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> heard Barry Tuckwell , who ’ s an Australian legend , in a master class and switched to horn from trumpet straight away ; my embouchure ( the shape of the mouth ) and sound quality immediately improved .” Now , only four years after picking up the horn , McIver has been selected for the Fellows program . “ This is the real deal .</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> know</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> need a serious , professional mind-set to work alongside the Sydney Symphony musicians .”</div>
    <div> “ What ’ s unique about the program ,” says Sydney Symphony Managing Director Rory Jeffes , “ is that it identifies and bridges the gap between being an outstanding young musician with sophisticated technical and musical skills and actually being ready for the profession . It addresses questions of interpersonal skills , non-verbal communication and body language , many of those ‘ soft skills ’. It ’ s very much about teaching them how to be a positive , contributing member of an orchestra . An awful lot of it isn ’ t just about how well you play your instrument .” Lately , the nine Fellows have been taking part in stagecraft workshops . “ One of the things it brought home to me ,” says oboe Fellow Rachel Cashmore , “ is that often we ’ re trained to be &gt;</div>

    <div> “ Nicholas was tremendous in the role ,” says Rory Jeffes , Managing Director . “ In investing in an Associate Conductor , the orchestra gained a valuable resource of ideas and thoughts , feedback from rehearsals with regards to how the orchestra is sounding out in the hall , and an assistant to all of the great international conductors visiting the Sydney Symphony .”</div>
    <div> Since then , the doors have truly opened for Carter . He ’ s now working as Assistant Conductor for the Hamburg State Opera where fellow Australian Simone Young is Music Director , and was invited by Scottish conductor Donald Runnicles to the Grand Teton Music Festival in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , during the northern summer .</div>
    <div> Busy times then ? “ Yeah .</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> already hate airports .” Time in transit allows for lots of score-learning , though . “ One of the biggest challenges is learning a lot of music in only a little time . I ’ m looking forward to everything getting easier with experience .”</div>

    <div> good classical musicians , but not necessarily good performers . An audience can really tell when musicians have learned the art of performing . It has to do with stage presence , focus , delivery , even eye contact . All of those things .”</div>
    <div> The program ’ s director , Roger Benedict ( principal viola of the Sydney Symphony ), says that more than</div>
    <div> 55</div>
    <div> percent of Fellowship alumni are now working in professional orchestras , in Australia and around the world – proof that the program works . “ We are , of course , training musicians for the Sydney Symphony . But we have to do more than that . We want them to be leaders – beacons – for the future . Whatever the future holds for music , we want the Fellows to be at the forefront of it .”</div>
    <div> Inspiration for the Future</div>
    <div> Though the orchestra is celebrating its</div>
    <div> 80th</div>
    <div> year in</div>
    <div> 2012</div>
    <div> , Jeffes says it ’ s vital that the orchestra adapts to stay relevant . Like the Greek god Janus , whose two faces looked to the future and the past , Jeffes acknowledges the long tradition this milestone brings with it , but also looks to the future , saying , “ anniversaries are only helpful if they also allow a forward-looking aspect . We see the art form of music , as well as the way in which it ’ s presented , as a live , developing art form , and not just a heritage art form .”</div>
    <div> Supporting and developing outstanding young musicians is key to this vision . Clarinetist Rowena Watts and bassoonist Melissa Woodroffe so valued the Fellowship in</div>
    <div> 2011</div>
    <div> that they ’ ve signed up for it again this year . “ The variety and number of opportunities offered to the Fellows is just invaluable . I ’ m an old hand now ,” Woodroffe says , “ but I ’ m so enjoying playing more chamber music , and working in the orchestra again .”</div>
    <div> For Watts , aspiring to be a musician came with a clear understanding of the challenges in achieving his ambition . “ Some people work as hard as they can , but still never quite get there .</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> like to know what lies ahead and to have things planned , but in this business , that isn ’ t always possible .” So what keeps her going ? “</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> love playing my instrument , pure and simple .</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> love interacting with other musicians and being able to express feelings and emotions through music . It ’ s as if something indefinable takes over and there ’ s nothing quite like it . To be able to do something that makes you feel like that every day is remarkable .</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> feel extremely lucky that I ’ m able to do this .” ı</div>
    <div> The Sydney Symphony ’ s Star Stature</div>
    <div> In 2012 , its 80th anniversary year , the Sydney Symphony is presenting four Gala concert series , all supported by Credit Suisse . Beethoven ’ s rousing “ Ode to Joy ” rang out in February as the opening concert of the season . Violin virtuoso Anne-Sophie Mutter performed with the orchestra in March . Later in the year , two further offerings are planned . Performances based on the sound track accompanying a screening of “ The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers ,” as well as an opera in concert , Tchaikovsky ’ s “ Queen of Spades .”</div>
    <div> With such diversity , the Sydney Symphony satisfies both sophisticated and varied tastes of concertgoers . “ The orchestra is at a point now where we are capable of inviting the finest soloists in the world to come to Australia , artists who have never before been here ,” says Managing Director Rory Jeffes . Previously , this part of the world may not have been on the agenda of such performers , but this is changing . Anne-Sophie Mutter and pianist Evgeny Kissin visited last year . The Sydney Symphony secured exclusive Sydney-only engagements with both . “ These are artists who have their pick of orchestras ,” he says . Their visits are possible due to the orchestra ’ s growing international reputation , its association with Principal Conductor and Artistic Advisor Vladimir Ashkenazy and the quality of the orchestra .</div>
    <div> Ashkenazy is clear that when it comes to the financial business of running orchestras , the situation can be challenging . “ We artists – we always lose money on everything . The orchestras cannot exist without financial help . Whenever a company understands the importance of promoting great arts , especially music , we are very grateful that they help us .”</div>

    <div> As the Hong Kong Arts Festival celebrates turning</div>

    <div> , it is more relevant than ever to a burgeoning cultural movement in Hong Kong .</div>

    <div> much-anticipated recital by cellist Danjulo Ishizaka , along with Martin Stadtfeld ’ s piano recital of Bach ’ s “ The Well-Tempered Clavier ” and two evening performances from the extraordinary Pavel Haas Quartet . The Arts Festival is one of the city ’ s most-highly regarded events . Both the number and stature of the artists appearing , as well as the rich diversity of the program on offer , gives it significant prominence both locally and internationally . Throughout the festival ’ s storied history it has attracted some of the world ’ s preeminent musicians and performers , including flautist James Galway , tenor José Carreras , the People ’ s Art Theatre of Beijing , Chinese-American cellist Yo-Yo Ma , choreographer Mikhail Baryshnikov , Philip Glass , the Royal Shakespeare Company , the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra , the Mariinsky Theatre and the famed Bolshoi Theatre .</div>
    <div> From Humble Beginnings</div>
    <div> The Hong Kong Arts Festival has become an important symbol for a small but committed section of Hong Kong society committed to promoting arts and culture in the city . It had its inception in the early</div>
    <div> 1970s</div>
    <div> when locally based art lover Charles Hardy broached the idea with Sir Kenneth Fung Ping-fan and Sir Run Run Shaw – who remains Honorary Life President – who agreed that Hong Kong should have a festival to promote the performing arts . “ Early audiences of the festival would be hard pressed to imagine the prestigious orchestras and glittering world stars gracing the stages of the festival today ,” said Charles Lee , chairman of Hong Kong Arts Festival Society . “ They would be awed by the richness and variety of programs and venues available in today ’ s festival . Indeed , the Hong Kong Arts Festival has become a leading cultural event for the whole region and attracts keen interest and anticipation from both visitors and locals alike .”</div>
    <div> A</div>
    <div> Feast for the Senses</div>
    <div> Hong Kong is often looked upon as lacking the cultural and artistic credentials it should possess as a city of its size and global presence . The city ’ s cultural detractors point to a paucity of local talent and a lack of government investment in the arts , but in truth the government has long been an active supporter of one of Asia ’ s largest arts events , the annual Hong Kong Arts Festival . This largesse has been an integral part of the Special Administrative Region ’ s commitment to funding , promoting and supporting the arts in Hong Kong . Throughout the festival ’ s four-decade-long history it has also been supported by the non-profit Hong Kong Jockey Club and a slew of private companies and organizations , including Credit Suisse . Since</div>
    <div> 2009</div>
    <div> Credit Suisse has been a major supporter of the festival , promoting young artists through the Credit Suisse Emerging Artists Series . This year ’ s featured performances come in the form of a Since those early days the festival has not only grown in size , prominence and stature , but also more multidisciplinary as it has evolved and today encompasses opera , music , theatre and dance .</div>
    <div> 2012</div>
    <div> has seen the emergence of the</div>
    <div> 40th</div>
    <div> edition of the event , which comprised</div>
    <div> 166</div>
    <div> performances in total (</div>
    <div> 38</div>
    <div> ensembles or solo artists from overseas and</div>
    <div> 16</div>
    <div> from Hong Kong ), played out over</div>

    <div> Opera is represented on a number of cultural fronts . While the Bavarian State Opera – again , widely recognized as one of the world ’ s premier outfits – will perform Mozart ’ s comic opera “ Così Fan Tutte ,” Hong Kong ’ s indigenous opera traditions are represented by a performance which pays tribute to the 1950s , considered the medium ’ s golden age , with “ Searching the Academy ,” based on a true story from the Qing dynasty , and a compilation piece presented by a stellar cast of both Hong Kong veterans and upcoming stars .</div>
    <div> Pavel Haas Quartet The four young Czech musicians have captured listeners and critics alike with their robust and relentless interpretation of a wide repertory of string quartets .</div>
    <div> Tribute to Laosheng</div>
    <div> Further to these two markedly different operatic styles , Beijing opera is also celebrated at the 40th Arts Festival with a tribute to Ma Lianlang , maestro of his day and most commonly associated with the “ laosheng ” ( bearded ) role . The Mei Lanfang Beijing Opera Troupe and successors of Ma will give three per formances of his most famous and loved works .</div>

    <div> After a long and distinguished career in arts administration , Zarin Mehta will retire this summer . Born into a well-known musical family in Mumbai , he himself pursued a career in finance . Yet , an interest in music stemming from his upbringing and his strong sense of civic responsibility led to a stint on the executive board of the Montreal Symphony . Only three years later , Mehta took a leave of absence from his accounting practice to manage the orchestra and never turned back . His nine-year tenure was just the beginning of a highly accomplished career in arts administration that has brought him from Montreal to Chicago and finally , to New York . “</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> grew up with music very much in my life ,” he said . “</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> achieved success by combining my training as an accountant with my family upbringing and the love of music .”</div>
    <div> During his career , Mehta has witnessed a profound change in the way orchestras are funded and how closely aligned the orchestra ’ s fortunes are with economic prosperity . In each role he broadened the reach of the orchestra and has been credited with commissioning new works , cultivating young musicians and exciting audiences worldwide through highly successful tours and technological innovation . “ In Montreal , we put a Canadian city on the world map ,” he recalled . “ Part of the success was the partnership with a local financial institution as a major sponsor . They funded extraordinary concerts and sent us on tours around the world . We played at the Montreal Forum , home of the Canadiens</div>

    <div> Zarin Mehta ’ s nine-year tenure was just the beginning of a highly accomplished career in arts administration that has brought him from Montreal to Chicago and finally to New York , where he has successfully led the New York Philharmonic through the first decade of the new millennium respecting the fragile balance between tradition and innovation .</div>
    <div> ( hockey ), to an audience of</div>
    <div> 16,000</div>
    <div> people . Another highlight was when Luciano Pavarotti joined the orchestra . No one had done that before .” Later , in</div>
    <div> 1990</div>
    <div> , Mehta moved to Chicago to lead the Ravinia Festival , a job he fondly remembers as very exciting and challenging at the same time . “ It gave me a chance to lead a well-managed festival with an excellent staff . It was really multidisciplinary ,” said Mehta . “</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> created the jazz festival . At one point we did</div>
    <div> 150</div>
    <div> concerts in three months . It was</div>
    <div> 10</div>
    <div> years of intense work , but with great musical pleasure .” When the opportunity arose to move to New York ten years later to lead the New York Philhar monic , Mehta admits he was unsure about relocating , but the opportunity to live and work in New York at the Philharmonic , where his brother , Zubin , was a former musical director , was too exciting to pass up . The first few years in New York were turbulent , Mehta recalls . Just one year after his arrival in</div>
    <div> 2000</div>
    <div> as executive director , the September</div>
    <div> 11th</div>
    <div> attacks occurred and financial support for the orchestra slowed significantly . The few years that followed were filled with great artistic achievement , but with limits on how much could be accomplished , especially on a global level . Credit Suisse came on board in</div>
    <div> 2007</div>
    <div> as the Philharmonic ’ s first and sole global sponsor , giving the orchestra both financial stability and a global platform on which to spread their artistic reach .</div>

    <div> “ The partnership with Credit Suisse is a highlight ,” said Mehta . “ We have been very pleased . It was a remarkable gesture on their part and we ’ re happy with them and their staff . We have had very good people from the bank on our board – Paul Calello and Antonio Quintella . We ’ ve had good relationships with senior executives . It has been a real win-win situation for both of us .”</div>

    <div> I</div>
    <div> wish Zarin nothing but the best in the future . He will be missed .” Through this partnership , the New York Philharmonic has toured worldwide and been exposed to many of the bank ’ s clients . “ They bring an audience to our doorstep ,” said Mehta . “ It is important for us to make contact with leaders of industry as potential investors . It helps that we are able to present extraordinary performances as theirs – to introduce clients to the music .”</div>

    <div> Between Tradition and Innovation</div>
    <div> “ Zarin Mehta has been a beacon of strong and wise leadership for the New York Philharmonic through</div>
    <div> 12</div>
    <div> memorable seasons ,” said Eric Latzky , vice president for communications at the New York Philharmonic . “ As an enthusiastic partner to three music directors – Kurt Masur , Lorin Maazel , and now Alan Gilbert – he has negotiated the complex path between tradition and innovation with an intuitive grace and dignity that has won him the respect and admiration of the orchestra , board of directors and staff . His legacy is clear : the preservation and advancement of the New York Philharmonic as a cultural icon and the codifying of its status as America ’ s primary cultural ambassador . Thanks to Zarin , we have so many new friends around the country , and indeed around the world .” Renewal such as that is a key reason Mehta said he ’ s chosen now to relinquish his role at the orchestra .</div>
    <div> “</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> think in all cultural organizations there has to be renewal ,” he said . “ I ’ m also of a certain age that someone new can come in with a breath of fresh air . Things change and</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> think that ’ s important .” Mehta and his family plan to move back to Chicago later this year and although he has no plans to take on another permanent job , he will make himself available to orchestras in need on a case-bycase consulting capacity . Upon reflection it is the stability through uncertainty that Mehta is most proud of , thanks in part to the Credit Suisse sponsorship . “</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> think often about the fact that through turbulent times we have maintained cultural musical mass ,” he said . “ We ’ ve done everything that we wanted to do .”</div>

    <div> In recent years a number of blockbuster exhibitions have drawn increasingly record crowds to London ’ s major galleries , but the National Gallery ’ s landmark “ Leonardo da Vinci : Painter at the Court of Milan ” show can surely claim to be the ultimate .</div>

    <div> Undoubtedly the</div>
    <div> 323,897</div>
    <div> people who saw the most complete display of da Vinci ’ s surviving paintings ever held would agree . This once-in-a-lifetime exhibition – the most popular and the fastest-selling in the National Gallery ’ s history – brought together a sensational collection of paintings and drawings that had never been seen before . Whilst numerous exhibitions have looked at Leonardo as an inventor , scientist or draftsman , this was the first show in the world solely dedicated to his aims and ambitions as a painter and displayed over sixty figurative works by the great artist , alongside works by some of his closest collaborators . The Credit Suisse sponsored exhibition concentrated on Leonardo ’ s career under Lodovico Sforza ’ s patronage during the</div>
    <div> 1480s</div>
    <div> and</div>
    <div> 1490s</div>
    <div> . Almost every surviving picture that he painted in the northern Italian city during this period was exhibited , alongside a unique collection of his preparatory drawings .</div>
    <div> The Most Anticipated Show</div>
    <div> Such was the buzz , all advance tickets to “ Leonardo da Vinci : Painter at the Court of Milan ” sold out within</div>
    <div> 48</div>
    <div> hours of the exhibition opening . This left just some</div>
    <div> 500</div>
    <div> tickets available for sale in the gallery each day , making them the hottest tickets in town . “ The new celebrity in town is Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci , subject of a major exhibition that has generated the hype of a Hollywood blockbuster ,” wrote Mike Collett-White for Reuters . Queues snaked around Trafalgar Square , forming earlier and earlier each day as the word spread . Bundled up in coats and sleeping bags against the cold , young and old alike could be seen and heard swapping stories and restorative cups of coffee from flasks as they waited for up to</div>
    <div> 12</div>
    <div> hours . In its last days the line began forming at</div>
    <div> 11</div>
    <div> p . m ., the night before the box office re-opened at</div>
    <div> 10</div>
    <div> a . m . the next morning . For many , the queue became an integral part of the whole experience , drawing comparisons with the near legendary</div>
    <div> 1972</div>
    <div> British Museum exhibition “ Treasures of Tutankhamun .”</div>
    <div> The gallery was mindful of doing everything in its power to make it as pleasurable as possible and so , to avoid the crushes experienced at previous blockbusters , restricted the numbers to</div>
    <div> 180</div>
    <div> people allowed in each half hour . “ You should probably be reading this review to the sound of a drum roll . The National Gallery ’ s ‘ Leonardo da Vinci : Painter at the Court of Milan ’ is the most eagerly awaited exhibition in living memory ,” observed Richard Dorment in The Daily Telegraph . “ Can an artist really be this good , let alone one who produced so few works and those in a calibrated perfection that might seem outdated today ?” asked The Independent ’ s Adrian Hamilton , who answered himself “ Yes , yes , yes . Forget the hype ; ignore all the articles and television programs blazoning the trail to this show . Just walk into it .”</div>
    <div> The Mystery Around Salvator Mundi</div>
    <div> One of the highlights of the show was the “ Salvator Mundi ” – Leonardo ’ s recently rediscovered painting thought missing and destroyed for centuries . This was the first time it had been exhibited after its attribution as a genuine Leonardo . “ I ’ m convinced . I ’ d go to the stake for it ,” said curator Luke Syson when interviewed by Alastair Sooke for The Daily Telegraph . So what was the consensus from visitors ? “ There ’ s not much question , when standing in front of the picture that it ’ s an authentic Leonardo ,” Bloomberg ’ s Martin Gayford expressed . However , writing in the Sunday Telegraph Andrew Graham-Dixon opined : “ The picture undeniably displays a number of the painter ’ s characteristic devices and mannerisms , but there are other aspects of it that seem foreign to Leonardo himself .” “ No Leonardo exhibition would be complete without a mystery ,” said Jonathan Jones in The Guardian . The debate rumbles on .</div>
    <div> Side by Side – for the First Time Ever</div>
    <div> No issue in the history of Renaissance art has perplexed experts more than why Leonardo da Vinci painted two versions of the “ Virgin of the Rocks .” The first ever juxtaposition of</div>

    <div> Amount of visitors allowed in each half hour : 180 people</div>
    <div> Number of tickets on sale daily in the National Gallery : around 500</div>

    <div> Smallest work in the exhibition : 2.2 × 2.2 cm ( Ducat of Lodovico il Moro , Italian , Milanese )</div>

  </article>
  <article n="49">
    <div heading="article"> the hype of a Hollywood blockbuster .”</div>
    <div> these two works – one owned by the National Gallery , the other by the Louvre , Paris – was for many the highpoint of “ Leonardo da Vinci : Painter at the Court of Milan ,” as it represented a unique chance to study these related works in their artistic contexts . Painted more than</div>
    <div> 20</div>
    <div> years apart , even Leonardo himself never saw them side by side .</div>
    <div> “ To have hung both versions in the same room for the first time in five centuries is an astonishing achievement for Luke Syson – were it in my power ,</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> would honor him with a life peerage ,” urged The Evening Standard ’ s Brian Sewell . Martin Gayford thought it revelatory : “ There has been endless debate about why two pictures of the same composition were required , and how much – if any – of the second work Leonardo painted himself . The exhibition gives a decisive answer to the second question . Clearly , most of the painting is by the master .”</div>
    <div> To Andrew Graham-Dixon , this summed up what the whole exhibition delivered for those who experienced it : “ Quite apart from the opportunity it affords to compare and contrast some of the most celebrated pictures in Western art ; the show is , above all , a celebration of Leonardo ’ s genius . Almost the full span of his powers can be appreciated in the assembled works .”</div>
    <div> The final word goes to The Times ’ Rachel Campbell Johnson who , it seems , speaks for all who witnessed it , saying she found her “ sight blurred by the tears which a sense of wonder has stirred .” “</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> want to work miracles ,” Leonardo once scribbled in his cryptic mirror script . This exhibition could be one of them . This show was not simply about expertly painted surfaces – it was about the responses they have stirred in their viewers . The mind of a genius brushed against you like a ghost . It is the single most amazing show</div>

    <div> have ever seen – or felt .” ı</div>

    <div> 10</div>
    <div> years –</div>
    <div> 40</div>
    <div> credit cycles in all . Like Patricia Bakari , all of them operate small businesses and have obtained miniloans of between</div>
    <div> 50</div>
    <div> and</div>
    <div> 100 US</div>
    <div> dollars from</div>
    <div> FINCA</div>
    <div> as start-up and development assistance , with the group as a whole acting as guarantor for each individual . Accordingly , only those villagers who enjoy the trust of the community – and above all that of Catherine Comacoma – can join .</div>

    <div> FINCA</div>
    <div> loan advisor Chisomo Mpfande also travels from Blantyre to attend the fortnightly meetings , where communal singing and dancing make the proceedings a more relaxed affair . In addition to discussing the precise terms and conditions of new applications or outstanding payments , she advises the women on problems and new challenges in their lines of business . “ Before the agreement is signed , she explains and calculates in very precise terms how much interest we have to pay each week and what the repayment rates are ,” says Catherine Comacoma . During her time as chairman , she says , she has seen many women who have improved their lives markedly because of the loan , women who now handle banking transactions as a completely routine matter . These are women who previously would not even have been let into the bank in most instances .</div>
    <div> Larger Loans for Established Outlets</div>
    <div> The service offered by</div>
    <div> FINCA</div>
    <div> in Malawi is not confined to miniloans . For instance , Maggie Bhakali and her husband have been running the</div>
    <div> TK</div>
    <div> Maxx Clothing Shop in Limbe , a suburb of Blantyre , for many years now . In order to purchase fashionable clothing from South Africa , she has already taken out numerous</div>

    <div> loans of several hundred</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> dollars – all repaid on time . What ’ s more ,</div>
    <div> Credit Suisse Microfinance Initiative Credit Suisse launched the Microfinance Capacity Building Initiative in 2008 to promote the development of the microfinance movement . The initiative focuses on the education of individuals , the development of processes in microfinance situations , and the microfinance product range . As part of the initiative , Credit Suisse works with four carefully selected partner organizations :</div>

    <div> the business is doing well . Maggie and her husband are already thinking about opening one or possibly two more boutiques , for which she would require a loan of at least one million Malawian kwachas – equivalent to about</div>
    <div> 6,000 US</div>
    <div> dollars . Maggie is confident about the future : “ We ’ re trying to take not only our business but also the whole country forward . Hopefully this will enable us one day to build our own house , buy a car , and send the children to a better school .”</div>
    <div> Ongoing Training Makes the Difference</div>
    <div> In order to maintain and further enhance a high-quality service for its</div>
    <div> 22,000-plus</div>
    <div> clients in Malawi ,</div>
    <div> FINCA</div>
    <div> offers regular training courses for middle management . These courses are delivered by the</div>
    <div> FINCA</div>
    <div> Development Academy , an organization launched in</div>
    <div> 2008</div>
    <div> and supported by Credit Suisse . The participants in Blantyre are enthusiastic about the opportunity to attend such courses . Says credit analyst Alexon Mwakhula : “ It is precisely these courses that make all the difference and have helped our organization as a whole to move forward . As a result , our managers now have a better idea of how to lead their employees . And that has led to improved figures .” That is because motivation inevitably increases in tandem with the quality of training .</div>
    <div> For Regional Head Peter Gama , however , it is clear that although Malawi , with its population of more than</div>
    <div> 14</div>
    <div> million , affords enormous growth potential for</div>
    <div> FINCA</div>
    <div> , not everyone will be able to get a loan . Sustainable growth is important , he says . In gen eral terms , the enormous optimism within the group is palpable . Asked about her own indi vidual career prospects , Branch Manager Rose Chanza replies with a smile that anything is possible . Why not even a leading position abroad with</div>

    <div heading="article"> Uetlihof 2 : Energy Efficiency that Works</div>
    <div> The Uetlihof , Credit Suisse ’ s largest office complex , in mid-March celebrated the opening of an innovative building on the site . Completed after three years of construction , the latest structure places a high priority on environmentally friendly design .</div>

    <div> Credit Suisse ’ s largest office complex , Uetlihof , has just gotten bigger . With the completion of a new structure , Uetlihof</div>
    <div> 2</div>
    <div> , adding some</div>
    <div> 2,000</div>
    <div> more workplaces , it brings the total at the complex in the south of Zurich to more than</div>
    <div> 8,000</div>
    <div> . Uetlihof</div>
    <div> 2</div>
    <div> sets high standards in many respects . Perhaps most impressive are features employees may not even notice : For example , Uetlihof</div>
    <div> 2</div>
    <div> is the largest building of its kind to get certification under Swiss “ Minergie-P-Eco ” standards . These include a much reduced need for energy to run the facility , even while maintaining high comfort . The new building has helped to save costs , thanks in part to a flexible design with smart workstations that adapt to employee needs . It also will allow Credit Suisse to give up offices in old , smaller and inefficient buildings elsewhere in Zurich .</div>
    <div> All the advantages offered by the new site “ help us to reduce annual workplace operating cost in the Zurich area by between</div>
    <div> 20</div>
    <div> to</div>
    <div> 30</div>
    <div> percent ,” says Rolf Krummenacher , Head of Corporate Real Estate and Services Switzerland . The increased ambience and modern workplace concept also contribute to more efficient use of office space . Savings are further realized by a highly modern energy system .</div>
    <div> A</div>
    <div> new second power plant increases reliability , making the site able to run independently of the grid , even if part of the system fails . This is all the more important given that the tenants at the site include Credit Suisse ’ s global administration .</div>

    <div> cafeteria . It has a sports zone that covers</div>
    <div> 2,000</div>
    <div> square meters , and an outdoor park complete with a natural pond . Yet even with all these features , new visitors to Uetlihof may be confused when they first see the site , which offers no skyscrapers , unlike Manhattan or London . Uetlihof</div>

    <div> , Credit Suisse first drew up plans to enlarge the old structure , but soon found it made more sense to build a new one . Following plans by Stücheli Architekten of Zurich , the building was razed to the ground level , leaving six floors below ground . Construction on Uetlihof</div>
    <div> 2</div>
    <div> commenced in January</div>
    <div> 2009</div>
    <div> and was largely completed in January</div>
    <div> 2012</div>
    <div> . One of the most challenging aspects of the process was building while busi ness went on as usual in the six floors beneath ground level , including in Credit Suisse ’ s mammoth printing facilities .</div>
    <div> Uetlihof</div>
    <div> 2</div>
    <div> sets high standards with regards to ecological design . The amount of recycled concrete used in the project is believed to be one of the highest ever for this type of construction . Its clever design has helped it to achieve the designation of Switzerland ’ s largest office building to meet the Swiss “ Minergie-P-ECO ” standards , requiring far less energy consumption than conventional structures . It also received the “</div>
    <div> GI</div>
    <div> ” certification for good air quality . “ In meeting these requirements , employees are assured of a comfortable and light-filled working environment , which meets the highest demands in terms of air quality ,” says Markus Nater , Head of Environmental Management , Credit Suisse Corporate Real Estate and Services Switzerland . The building also achieves the “</div>
    <div> 2,000-watt</div>
    <div> ” objective formulated by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich . This target seeks to strike a balance between the needs for energy in modern societies , based on achiev ing per capita energy consumption of</div>
    <div> 2,000</div>
    <div> watts .</div>
    <div> It is possible in part due to good insulation of the façade , along with a second outer façade that shields the inner one from the elements . Flexible metal panels allow sunshine into the building to be regulated and directed . The low requirement for heat is met by a very efficient heating pump that utilizes the large volumes of warmth given off by the data center , sufficient even to supply heating to nearby residences in the area . The building is able to capture the warmth and transfer it to ceilings , where elements circulate the heat as needed .</div>
    <div> A</div>
    <div> special ceiling relies on a layer of overlapping , irregularly shaped “ leaves ” that not only support acoustics but also provide cooling as necessary through a flexible set of tubes on the side next to the ceiling . These “ chill ” panels can be easily rearranged to suit how the rooms are used . The interior gets daylight from three atriums , which additionally assist in air circulation and provide meeting points . Each floor is divided into a number of areas : team zones , a “ marketplace ,” a core area where employees can converse , small meeting rooms , larger project areas , quiet zones and gardens .</div>
    <div> “ The building is unique not only because of its green characteristics , but also because it is the first</div>
    <div> CS</div>
    <div> building where there will be hardly any traditional offices – nearly all areas allow employees to have a variety of different working area options ,” according to Rolf Gerber , who led the Uetlihof</div>
    <div> 2</div>
    <div> project . Once the day ’ s work is done , the building also offers visitors a chance to take advantage of what could be one of Uetlihof ’ s most inviting features , thanks to its location . Putting on sturdy shoes , in less than an hour they can hike up the forest trails near the office to the top of the Uetliberg . For those who enjoy getting out , on clear days they will be rewarded by a panoramic view of Zurich , the lake and the Alps . ı</div>

    <div heading="article"> Ending the Rejection Cycle Helping Young Adults Land Jobs</div>
    <div> No work experience means no job . Day in , day out , this is the hard truth confronting scores of young people as they seek to gain entry into the labor market . The stress increases with every unsuccessful attempt . The Coaching Transfair 2 project run by the Swiss Labor Assistance offers a way to break out of this negative cycle and start on the jobs ladder .</div>

    <div> It ’ s just before midday . Eliana is sitting in the break room with a big smile . “ At last I ’ ve found an internship . I ’ m so happy ! It ’ s a great feeling .” For the commercial</div>
    <div> apprentice , it ’ s not something that can be taken for granted . “ It was a difficult time for me , full of self-doubt , setbacks and lows .</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> was turned down 459 times and felt like a failure – and</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> didn ’ t know what</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> was doing wrong ,” she says . “ It was frustrating hearing the same reasons time and again . It was either that</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> had no work experience or was too young , but often they said it was because</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> didn ’ t fit the company ’ s image . That hurts – it chips away at your self-esteem ,” says Eliana , age 20. Yvonne tells a similar story of frustration . After completing vocational training to work as a cook , she had difficulty finding a job . “</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> certainly must have applied for</div>
    <div> 300</div>
    <div> positions without success ,” she says .</div>
    <div> Neither of these two cases is unusual . As per the end of February</div>
    <div> 2012</div>
    <div> , in Switzerland</div>
    <div> 19,080</div>
    <div> young people were jobless . After finishing an apprenticeship or college , those young people who fail to land their first permanent job risk falling into a negative spiral . The longer they stay unemployed , the more serious the consequences . The pressure to find a position and the emotional stress that goes with it increases with each rejection . This can result in a negative spiral of feeling useless , leading these young adults to doubt their abilities and ultimately lose motivation .</div>
    <div> Fit for the Job Market</div>
    <div> Swiss Labor Assistance (</div>
    <div> SLA</div>
    <div> ), with financial support from Credit Suisse , launched the Coaching Transfair</div>
    <div> 2</div>
    <div> program ,</div>
    <div> CT2</div>
    <div> for short , to ensure that young adults who have completed an apprenticeship or studies can at least get professional advice in difficult situations .</div>
    <div> CT2</div>
    <div> is aimed at unemployed</div>
    <div> 18</div>
    <div> - to</div>
    <div> 30-year-old</div>
    <div> apprentices and graduates , and provides assistance in integrating them into the job market . “ We ’ re not a recruitment agency or self-service job center ,” stresses Regina Sieber , job coach and project manager with</div>
    <div> SLA</div>
    <div> Berne . “ Instead , we support , encourage and motivate young people to enable them to find their first job independently .” Her colleague , Claudio de Simone , adds : “ There are many ways you can go wrong ,</div>

    <div> including poor self-marketing or an unkempt appearance , or offering a prospective employer a worn-out</div>
    <div> CV</div>
    <div> and other information containing spelling mistakes , or by revealing too many personal details .” In job interviews , he says , some job seekers readily admit that they don ’ t always worry about being on time and often sleep in . Sieber , who is trained in adult education , also says that résumés listing hobbies like hanging out or drinking are not rare . “ We force young people to look at themselves , starting with their application materials . That ’ s their calling card – their entry ticket to the job interview , as it were .”</div>

    <div> 10</div>

    <div> provides extensive support to young adults seeking a job .</div>
    <div> CT2</div>
    <div> focuses on research and the preparation for job seekers , coaching and applications , regular workshops , and stays with them to provide support throughout the integration phase in early stages of employment .</div>
    <div> At the application workshop , young people compile informative application materials , write cover letters , practice interview techniques and get simple but effective tips . “</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> always thought my application letters were good until Ms . Sieber crossed out unnecessary , negative filler words like “ only ” or “ actually ” in nearly every sentence . Then</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> noticed how badly I ’ d been representing myself ,” recalls intern Eliana . “ We learned to tailor our response specifically to fit the description of the open position ,” Yvonne adds . In the meantime she ’ s found a permanent position . The coaches help jobseekers to develop per sonal strengths , assess skills , discuss appli cation strategies and set milestones . This framework also allows shortcomings and sensitive</div>
    <div> Credit Suisse Pledges Its Support Credit Suisse is committed to improving professional opportunities for young people as part of its long-term efforts to promote Switzerland as a center for education and jobs . In 2009 , the bank announced that it was providing 30 million Swiss francs as part of an initiative to tackle youth unemployment . To achieve the objectives of this initiative , Credit Suisse is working together with expert partners . One of them is Swiss Labor Assistance ( SLA ), whose Coaching Transfair 2 project – CT2 for short – has gained support from Credit Suisse since August 2010. The 10 regional SLA groups help hundreds of unemployed young people every year . The 18- to 30-year-olds who have completed a recognized form of training ( apprenticeship , university of applied sciences , university ), or are about to complete one and are ­l o o k i n g­for­their­first­job­can­register­free­of­charge . ­The­aim­of­the­CT2­program­isto ensure that 85 percent of the young adults leave with an employment contract .</div>

    <div> Moira Forbes</div>
    <div> President and Publisher of ForbesWoman</div>
    <div> The inaugural Forbes Forum : Asia ’ s Power Business Women , organized in collaboration</div>
    <div> with Credit Suisse , celebrated the dynamic ways in which women are wielding power and</div>
    <div> influence in a region that has become a hotbed for entrepreneurship , investment and</div>
    <div> economic opportunity . During the event in Singapore this March , Moira Forbes ,</div>
    <div> President and Publisher of ForbesWoman , spoke about the relationship between women ,</div>
    <div> the economy , power and valuable tips on success .</div>
    <div> bulletin : In this environment of global economic turmoil ,</div>
    <div> what can we learn about the connection between women</div>
    <div> and economics ?</div>
    <div> Moira Forbes : The global downturn has been a huge wake-up call , particularly for women whose economic influence is on the rise worldwide , particularly in emerging markets . Women are not only leading in meaningful ways in the workplace , but they are also playing an increasingly active role in the investment decisions around their own finances as well as those of their household .</div>
    <div> Given these changes , do you anticipate that</div>
    <div> women will continue to play a greater role in driving the</div>
    <div> global economy moving forward ?</div>
    <div> Women are fundamental to our future economic prosperity , representing one of the greatest untapped resources for talent and innovation around the world . Advancing more women into business and positions of leadership is not just a gender issue , but also an economic imperative for every nation today . Those who change the paradigm for women ’ s representation in the corporate workforce or in empowering entrepreneurship are visionaries in identifying the greatest economic powerhouse of future growth . While women may have achieved notable successes to date , there is still much more progress to be made in breaking deeply entrenched gender barriers .</div>
    <div> How is women ’ s ability to exert power changing ?</div>
    <div> Today , women not only hold traditional power roles of business and government , but they also have unprecedented opportunities to exert influence in new and unconventional ways – ways that shape culture , drive provocative conversations , and set the agenda on some of the most critical issues of our day . Cultural impact can mean as much as money and political influence .</div>
    <div> Could you elaborate on the “ new and unconventional ways ”</div>
    <div> that women are exerting influence ?</div>
    <graphic image="I104" x="274.65" y="667.32" width="82.78" height="118.91"/>
    <div> Today ’ s rapidly evolving environment has created far more ways to change conversations and shape communities . In many respects , new media has democratized our ability to achieve influence and with unprecedented pace and scale . Watching the success of those women who have created mega-businesses through their mega-personal brands is a testament to this , as is their ability to move millions , if not billions , with one click of a mouse .</div>
    <div> Influence can be fleeting these days . How can we</div>
    <div> be sure to sustain it ?</div>
    <div> There is a great difference between temporary prominence and lasting influence . After interviewing dozens of women over the past years , a key theme to gaining , and sustaining , influence has emerged : authenticity . Lasting success will never come from acting out of pretense rather than passion .</div>
    <div> Lasting influence must be an important measure in the</div>
    <div> Forbes annual “ Power Women ” list . What other prerequisites</div>
    <div> are required ?</div>
    <div> Our annual list of the world ’ s</div>
    <div> 100</div>
    <div> Most Powerful Women looks at a combination of hard power , from money and might , as well as ( thanks to social media ) reach and , as you mentioned , influence . The list also takes into account women who leverage their power and networks across multiple spheres of influence , capitalizing on success in one arena to lead positive change in another .</div>
    <div> Who are those “ Power Women ,” what are they like ?</div>
    <div> They are women from the worlds of politics , media , business and philanthropy . Undoubtedly , they exert influence in different ways , to different ends , and with different impacts on the global community . They lead multibillion dollar corporations , they govern our world , but they also shape the cultural fabric of our lives . While these women may be as different as Lady Gaga and Angela Merkel , all have achieved power through connectivity – the ability to build a community around the organizations they oversee , &gt;</div>

    <div> 56 Leader</div>
    <div> If you spend all your time trying to avoid failure you ’ ll necessarily avoid the risks that ultimately lead to success .</div>
    <div> the countries they lead , the causes they champion and their personal brands – now this is power .</div>
    <div> You use the word power a lot – how do you define it ?</div>
    <div> Power is the ability to influence , to move people , to affect change , to shape minds – whatever the platform , issue or realm .</div>
    <div> Alongside the economic downturn we discussed , the</div>
    <div> landscape of entrepreneurship has changed – what are the</div>
    <div> best practices to navigate this ?</div>
    <div> The common leadership qualities that unite women who have achieved such uncommon success are no different when looking at accomplished entrepreneurs versus corporate executives today . These women were willing to take risks , make unconventional choices , and take the paths that defied expectations . They saw opportunities where others saw roadblocks and worked toward finding creative ways to attain their goals , and find solutions to meet the needs of new customers , new markets , and in particular , the needs of their own lives .</div>
    <div> We are also more often seeing women employ entrepre-</div>
    <div> neurial solutions to address social problems . Entrepreneurship</div>
    <div> has become a type of glue , uniting women from different</div>
    <div> cultures and lifestyles …</div>
    <div> Social entrepreneurship , whether through micro-financ ing or educational programs , has proven to be one of the most powerful models of change in the</div>
    <div> 21st</div>
    <div> century . If one woman is empowered , the giving chain begins – a family is transformed , a community prospers , and the giving chain can build the momentum to seed change across an entire nation . Cultural transformation though is critical to creating sustained models for economic and social prosperity . Long-term success can only thrive when steep gender and cultural barriers to women ’ s economic empowerment are transformed as well .</div>
    <div> On the topic of change , we seem to be in an environment</div>
    <div> where change is the only true constant – based on your experience at ForbesWoman , what are the best strategies for</div>
    <div> leading businesses from one level of operation to the next ?</div>
    <div> Navigating through these times of constant change have tasked us all as leaders . They have necessitated that leaders develop</div>
    <div> far greater flexibility , to see a micro-trend coming and to transform it into a macro-movement , to create a distinctive brand that stands out in our world of information and reach a global community .</div>
    <div> Disruption of traditional models and rapid innovation will continue to define the</div>
    <div> 21st</div>
    <div> century . Confronting dramatic change and instability is often a difficult process for organizations to undergo , yet this will distinguish companies who failed to innovate from those who achieve long-term success .</div>
    <div> You ’ re right at the crux of an extremely exciting , yet</div>
    <div> demanding industry . Did you feel it your duty to go into the</div>
    <div> publishing business to represent earlier generations ?</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> have always been passionate about business , even at a young age . For my ninth birthday</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> asked my grandfather , Malcolm Forbes , for a briefcase and office supplies . Highlights during my summer holidays included joining my father in his office where</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> dis covered that filing papers was far more exciting than going to the movies ( a sentiment which has since changed !). My sisters and</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> were encouraged to be authentic to our own sense of self and build a life around our passions rather than the pressures from others . For me ,</div>
    <div> I</div>
    <div> discovered a love for business and media that drove my passion to join the family company .</div>
    <div> Talk us through some of your secrets for success .</div>
    <div> Own who you are and what you want : By embracing rather than fighting who you are , you will be more successful and far more satisfied in life . Don ’ t be afraid to take the road less traveled , or even sit on the side of the road for a while : The path to success is not always a conventional or continuous one . Know the difference between power and influence and recognize that you don ’ t need to have one in order to exert the other . Embrace failure as a necessary and integral part of the path to success . Related to this , build up resilience : Setbacks are a part of everyone ’ s life .</div>
    <div> Finally , understand your core values and priorities across the multiple spheres of your life . If you spend all your time trying to correct your flaws you ’ ll miss the opportunity to build your strengths , if you spend all your time trying to avoid failure you ’ ll necessarily avoid the risks that ultimately lead to success .</div>
