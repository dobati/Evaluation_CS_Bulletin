At a concert by Erich Kleiber, in his hometown, the young Solti experienced the electrifying energy emanating from the conductor that held both the musicians and the audience in its spell &#8211; an event that helped him discover his calling. He was drawn to music already at a very early age, learned to play the piano, and had his first public appearance at age twelve. Having discovered his love for conducting, he devoted all his energies to its pursuit and never veered off this path for the next seventy years. He passed countless milestones, overcame obstacles, and ultimately reached the summit of his career, always in the company of people who spurred him on in his development. At the end of his long career, he had the fortune of looking back over a fulfilled life. To quote from his biography: &#8220; Every day I believe more strongly that I have a guardian angel who has stood by me throughout my life. Of course there were also disappointments, but I enjoyed a blessed and wonderful life for which I &#8217; m very grateful.&#8221;</span></td>

Solti was completely taken by observing people from entirely different cultures, with different languages and ways of life, who were transformed into a single entity while performing music. As a witness of the Second World War, he had a heightened awareness of the need for harmony and understanding among people. This gave him the idea of putting together an orchestra of international musicians that gives concerts around the world and communicates the message of peace and harmony in the universal language of music.

Not an easy task, when considering that the musicians come to rehearsals from around the world and have to organize their leave in the orchestras in which they normally play. Furthermore, the musicians do not get paid, and this strengthens their commitment toward a worthy cause.

The natural choice was, of course, Valery Gergiev, an outstanding conductor in his own right and a friend of Solti. Although they became acquainted only six months before Solti &#8217; s death, Solti regarded him as a kind of soulmate who mirrored phases of his own life. Solti thus took him under his wing, similar to the way he received help from Bruno Walter in his own youth.

For example, the opening concert of the World Orchestra for Peace can be traced to a meeting between her and Ms Boutros-Boutros Ghali.

He really pushes himself, and has also been known to come late, which doesn &#8217; t always go over too well with musicians, but he really is a genius. During the concert in London, the atmosphere in the concert hall was as if charged with electricity, something that doesn &#8217; t happen too often. He seems almost possessed at times and sometimes comes across as arrogant, but this can also have a motivating effect and causes the players to give their utmost in an attempt to satisfy him.</span></td>

Of course, it &#8217; s a great honor to be chosen to lead a section. At the same time, there &#8217; s a strong need to stay flexible and to be able to adjust quickly.

Although I play solos occasionally, I find that soloists tend to lead rather lonely lives. They travel from one orchestra to another and always have to get used to other people. Soloists are with an orchestra for only a short time, and it &#8217; s therefore hard to make contacts. This is why a solo career was never my dream. Appearing as a soloist with top orchestras of course also means working your way up to an entirely different league.</span></td>

Well, the World Orchestra for Peace doesn &#8217; t exist as a permanent ensemble. We have to ask each time who will play in the next performance. This means we have to do a lot of planning, and we also need more rehearsals than a normal orchestra. At the same time, I think it &#8217; s a better orchestra than most &#8211; not because it &#8217; s been around for so long, but because the individual members are so excellent. Just imagine: last time we had 14 concertmasters among the first violins! That &#8217; s really extraordinary.</span></td>

<tr>
<td><span style="font-size:9.25pt;">But a good orchestra is surely worth more than the sum of its parts? In our case, what matters most is the enthusiasm and commitment for the project. Nobody is forced to play in the World Orchestra for Peace, and there are no contracts. But it &#8217; s the concept as a whole that is so inspiring for most of the players. The idea is to meet up sporadically with colleagues from around the world and to play at the very highest level. This requires an enormous amount of goodwill from everyone. Nobody is forcing musicians to travel halfway around the world just to be able to play in this orchestra, to perform in four cities in just under one week, and to clock up countless air miles. However, all the players believe that this is a unique opportunity that they have to seize. It &#8217; s only natural to be curious about what it &#8217; s like to play with musicians from 70 different orchestras.</span></td>

As conductor I find this situation really fascinating. And I think I have a special responsibility in being particularly understanding and bringing about a friendly and creative atmosphere. The musicians are very friendly with each other and also listen carefully to what others are saying. They are all highly qualified. We are very fortunate that we have music as the common language, which provides us with a basis for working together. I also think it wouldn &#8217; t hurt if the leaders of different countries would get together once in a while to make music or simply to communicate a bit more.</span></td>

For many viewers this will be the very first time that they hear our music.

Let &#8217; s take Russia for example, where I come from: After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the first thing I noticed was this colorless, mushlike tendency in culture. It seemed as if everything was becoming more and more grey. During Soviet times we had live broadcasts from the Bolshoi and the Mariinsky Theater showing famous ballet dancers and brilliant musicians such as David Oistrach and Swjatoslav Richter. Unfortunately these days are over. Now, in Russia, we are just as inundated with the standard cultural fare as in other countries. I consider this to be a form of cultural poverty. To see this happening in my native country, which has such a rich cultural tradition, is particularly painful. The Soviet system was bad for people, but not for music.</span></td>

My &#222; rst concert in China, in Shanghai, was a bit disappointing because I saw so many Western faces in the audience. I told my agent that I didn &#8217; t want to perform in China if 75 percent of the audience was European. I wanted to perform mostly for young people, for those who would otherwise have no chance to hear classical music. I insisted that the auditoriums should be open to them too, because I wanted as many young people as possible to have an opportunity to hear us. In Beijing we did have a full house and the audience was almost entirely Chinese.</span></td>

<tr>
<td><span style="font-size:9.25pt;">What else did you find to be memorable? China is in a very dynamic development phase and this is also reflected in its musical life. The Chinese are increasingly warming to Western classical music. This means that young musicians no longer need to study in Berlin or London, but can find good teachers to work with in their own country. I think that classical music has a big future in China. Also, I &#8217; m lucky in that two of the most well-known Chinese musicians, Lang Lang, the pianist, and Tan Dun, the conductor, have become my friends. What I found to be particularly exciting was that our concert in Beijing was broadcast on television. We had an audience of approximately 400 million viewers. Can you imagine? That &#8217; s roughly the same number as for a major football match. &gt;</span></td>

But the Caucasus region, where I come from originally, continues to be a very unstable place. What matters most right now is that the leaders of the region understand how important stability, education and economic development really are. Unfortunately, there are still very few leaders who seem to understand this and who are committed to bringing about peace. Most leaders continue to talk about how great they are. Well, every nation is great, and unique, and a breeding ground for achievers and talent.

At age 34 I was rather young for such a position and I quickly realized that I wanted to take on more responsibility. What helped me the most at the beginning was that I was elected instead of appointed. That &#8217; s a big difference. The family of artists usually doesn &#8217; t take kindly to anyone who is appointed by a minister, and the critical gap for being accepted is very wide. However, I was elected by the artists themselves, which meant I had their trust. That was and remains one of the very important elements in the work we do together. This kind of trust provides me with the extra portion of energy needed to do something exceptional. I guess it &#8217; s true that I ask a lot from the people I work with, but I &#8217; m even more demanding on myself. I work harder than all the others.</span></td>

His eyes glow with enthusiasm as he talks about the piece and he spurs and praises his players until he has the nuance he wants. And then, the beaming schoolboy radiance of joy when he gets the result he was looking for. He is a hard worker, profusely perspiring during rehearsals, let alone during performances, and the concert hall at times has more resemblance to a sports arena. He stretches his orchestra &#8217; s limits and expects everyone, especially himself, to give their utmost. The Kirov Orchestra is only too familiar with the energy he pours into his work, and its musicians readily recall the legendary tour in which the orchestra performed four operas in six cities in seven days.

Bach, Handel and Vivaldi all conducted their works while seated at the keyboard or playing the violin. In the early days, musical directors would lead performances by banging a heavy stick on the floor. The most famous of these was Jean-Baptiste Lully, conductor of Louis XIV, the Sun King, who rose to fame because he accidentally jabbed his foot with his conducting stick during an outburst of enthusiasm and ended up dying from gangrene: the first case in which conducting proved to be fatal.</span></td>

<td><span style="font-size:9.25pt;">Of the major conductors of the twentieth century, a good number are remembered as lording over their orchestras and being utterly intolerant of any contrarian views. Arturo Toscanini, known for his legendary tirades during rehearsals, was the &#222; rst absolute ruler among conductors. He regarded his highest musical calling to be delivering a perfect reproduction of what the composer had written. For him the score was an inviolable law, and the conductor was there to execute rather than to create. During the Romantic Period, conductors took great liberties with scores by adjusting them to suit their personal preferences. Hans von B&#252;low, for instance, reworked the Beethoven symphonies because he believed that a deaf composer couldn &#8217; t possibly have intended that which was written. Thirty years after Toscanini &#8217; s death, it was discovered that the purist maestro himself touched up parts of Beethoven &#8217; s last symphonies, but did his best to cover his tracks.</span></td>

He seems to have had a knack for composing opera, because he completed forty in less than twenty years.

Even while at music conservatory, he had the repu tation of being a &#8220; dangerous rev o- lutionary.&#8221; Although he often cri ticized Richard Wagner, it was precisely Wagner &#8217; s harmonies that helped him to realize his own musical direction. Debussy was working toward the emancipation of individual chords, and used to ask his fellow students, &#8220; Are you not capable of hearing chords without asking questions about their particular characteristics, such as: Where do they come from? Where are they going? Just listen to them, that is enough!&#8221; Debussy &#8217; s subtle art of orchestration and his liberation of sound from structure had a seminal influence on later composers, such as B&#233;la Bart&#243;k, Edgar Var&#232;se, Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen and even the jazz mu sician Duke Ellington. The &#8220; Pr&#233;lude,&#8221; which is based on an erotic poem by St&#233;phane Mallarm&#233;, led to a &#8220; revolution in musical awareness,&#8221; according to the composer Jean Barraqu&#233;.

Furthermore, Charles Kaye, the orchestra &#8217; s director, is also someone I know well from that time. In recent years, however, I fell out of touch with the orchestra, until I heard about it again by chance from a relationship manager of Credit Suisse who told me they were planning to go on tour, but that financing had not yet been secured. I contacted Kaye, who won us over with his plans.

Classical music is a unifying force that is played and understood all over the world. You &#8217; ll hear Beethoven played in China as readily as in Africa. Sir Georg Solti frequently talked about his conviction that music is the means by which people around the world understand each other; it has an innate element of peace about it. In this vein, music is primarily a manifestation of peace because it fosters communication and dialog &#8211; whereby musicians invariably become ambassadors of peace.</span></td>

In Switzerland, Credit Suisse is partner to the most important public cultural institutions.

The enormous cultural diversity that we observe today is a totally new phenomenon that simply can no longer be financed by public institutions. Furthermore, in the course of the past ten years, many patrons of the arts have reduced, rather than increased, their donations. The resulting gap has largely been filled by cultural sponsorship, which most companies &#8211; including Credit Suisse &#8211; use as a marketing instrument. Today, funds from sponsorship play a very important role in cultural life.</span></td>

As an &#8220; umbrella &#8221; concept, it featured theater productions, museums, workshops, symposiums and other cultural events held throughout the summer months. But generally, we only enter into long-term sponsorship commitments because doing so also helps our partners gain a certain amount of security in terms of planning and gives them a reasonable perspective for what they want to achieve. With this strategy we provide &#8211; in addition to basic financing from the public side &#8211; an important basis for projects of cultural institutions that could otherwise not be realized. These often include ventures of up-and-coming artists, and also commissions for new compositions &#8211; two areas that are essential for tomorrow &#8217; s society and that serve to develop art per se. Today, sponsorship is a highly professional marketing instrument that is used by most companies. Compared with the selfless donations of patrons, who frequently ask to remain anonymous, the sponsorship concept has nothing to do with philanthropy because the sponsor expects a return on its investment. And, compared with a foundation, a sponsor will not claim to be promoting art, but rather sees itself as a financier of culture.</span></td>

<tr>
<td><span style="font-size:9.25pt;">How has cultural sponsorship developed over the past decade? Without a doubt, it has become a lot more professional. In the past, art relied much more heavily on generous patrons, and sponsorship often revolved around the boss &#8217; s hobbies. This would be inconceivable under today &#8217; s corporate governance model because we are, after all, investing the company &#8217; s money, which we can &#8217; t distribute randomly on the basis of one person &#8217; s preferences. Cultural sponsorship is an investment that brings with it the expectation of a return and that can be clearly defined and measured in terms of brand awareness and client satisfaction, for example.</span></td>

In this regard, the Americans live in a different world, a contrast that makes sense when seen from a historical perspective. In Switzerland, and in Europe as a whole, culture was traditionally commissioned and financed by the church and the court. This means we have a strong tradition of public support for the arts that is based on the cultural and educational mandates of individual countries. This was never the case in the United States, a relatively new country, where culture has generally been funded from private sources and where there is a completely different concept of sponsorship. Nevertheless, I think there &#8217; s a chance that we &#8217; ll be moving in that direction at some point in the future. At the same time, I believe it &#8217; s important that we in Europe stick to our model of using both public and private financing for sponsorship. I don &#8217; t think that private money should replace public support because the government is, after all, responsible for taking care of its citizens &#8217; basic needs. Culture is something that requires support too, and it could not exist without subsidies.</span></td>

<td><span style="font-size:9.25pt;">You previously worked for a number of cultural institutions. What did you learn by crossing the divide between the public and private realms? Companies and their partners in the cultural arena must agree on a common language. A lot of damage is done when one party fails to understand what the other side needs. It &#8217; s therefore necessary to arrive at a set of shared values that fully coincide. Anyone who asks a company to act as sponsor must clearly know why he or she has chosen that particular company. Sponsorship is unlikely to live up to expectations unless there is a significant degree of affinity between the partners. The simple rationale that &#8220; this is a bank, they have money, they sponsor cultural events, we do culture, therefore they &#8217; ll give us money &#8221; is not enough. &lt;</span></td>

Beethoven was one of the &#222; rst composers to be played once again in China. His social criticism partially stemmed from discussions he had with Goethe, whose respect for authority he repeatedly attacked.
