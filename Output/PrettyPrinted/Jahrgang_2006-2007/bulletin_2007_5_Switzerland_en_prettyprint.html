<td><span style="font-size:9.25pt;">As passionate outdoor sportsmen with a love of skiing and the world of snow in general, Pierre Yves Guernier and Yan Berchten had often asked themselves whether there might be another effective way of saving mountaineers from fatal avalanche accidents. And so the pair set out on a journey that would eventually lead them to create the Snowpulse Airbag, a self-inflating cushion of air that provides a handy and effective solution in the realm of avalanche rescue. The device enables those caught in an avalanche to get to the surface of a snow mass. This sausage-shaped plastic capsule that fills with air at the touch of a button thanks to a high-pressure air cartridge, is designed not only to save lives, but also to prevent serious injuries, as it simultaneously acts as a buffer that protects the wearer &#8217; s rib cage, head, neck and back.</span></td>

In the Arktis Radiation Detector they have developed a form of technology that is able to detect atomic rays in a precise and differentiated manner, thereby helping to prevent nuclear-based terrorist attacks. This high-tech sleuth looks like a giant car wash system, through which trucks or freight containers can be passed at border crossings.</span></td>

Arktis Radiation Detectors measure a broad spectrum of rays and thus allow a more precise evaluation of potentially dangerous freight content. The two physicists Rico Chandra and Giovanna Davatz, from the Institute for Particle Physics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Zurich, and their business partner Mario V&#246;geli are aware that their technology is currently only suitable for large-scale application. Nonetheless, the potential exists to adapt the techno logy at a later stage to smaller devices for deployment at airports. This would enable personal luggage to be searched for nuclear material as well as chemical or biological weapons, for example. Specialists believe that the market potential for this ingenious technology is very high. A great deal more time, money and stamina will be required before the prototype currently being developed by the inventors can be converted into a marketable product that will attract governments and security services.</span></td>

When a flooding alarm is raised, the cushions are pumped up against building openings that are under threat from flooding. The necessary stability and fit of the cushion, which come in both standard and special sizes, are guaranteed by their special internal structure and pressure, beside which sandbags pale in comparison.</span></td>

During this storm, an air-filled dinghy got wedged so tightly in a hatch on the deck that no more water flooded in, despite waves crashing over the deck. The pressure of the water, together with the compressed air of the lifeboat, created a completely watertight seal. The protective cushion developed by Dobler &#8217; s team applies the same principle to counter flooding. The parties showing major interest in the invention are mainly insurance companies and local authorities. That the relatively inexpensive cushion has a future seems a well-founded assumption: New land continues to be developed for residential settlement in flood-threatened areas, thus preventing or inhibiting the natural drainage of water, a problem that further increases the danger of flooding.</span></td>

For pilots, paragliders and hot-air balloonists, precise knowledge of thermals can save lives in certain circumstances. Particularly innovative at meteoblue are the graphically unique real-time images and the general availability of information on the Internet. The technological advantage over the competition is ensured thanks to the use of computers that offer superior performance.

Just because something &#8217; s worthy of a Nobel Prize doesn &#8217; t necessarily mean it &#8217; s abstruse. From a technical standpoint, other researchers could have discovered what we did if they had been convinced they could do it. Some had even considered it. From an intellectual point of view, it wasn &#8217; t that extreme. It just took courage to make it happen.</span></td>

<tr>
<td><span style="font-size:9.25pt;">Analytics are generally the first step in a new field of research. Nanotechnology is really just another stage in the natural progression toward greater miniaturization. In other words, the direction of development was a given. In Switzerland, this trend played an important role early on. For instance, the church clock was developed into the wristwatch. In terms of precision tools, the micrometer very quickly became the standard. Its replacement by the nanometer is a logical extension of this process. To that extent, there &#8217; s nothing groundbreaking about nanotechnology itself. It &#8217; s the possibilities that arise as a result of the development that are truly exciting.</span></td>

<td><span style="font-size:9.25pt;">Take for example the Manhattan Project, which was called into existence during the Second World War to develop the atomic bomb. Back then, it was said that we needed it; that it was essential for our survival. The people who worked on it all shared this conviction, and they ultimately succeeded. Two things are necessary for an enterprise like that: First, you need good people, and second, you need the political and social consensus. Once you have both, you can make concentrated progress happen. In most cases you can &#8217; t predict who will come up with what idea or when. What &#8217; s more, the direction in which the application of research develops is not decided by the researchers, but rather by society. Ultimately it &#8217; s only things that can be sold that are produced. Society determines the demand and thus that &#8217; s the way the fruits of research are applied. If society could also determine the areas of research there would no longer be any research whose fruits we might desperately need some time in the future. This applies in particular to the research efforts of recent years, even the surge of ideas we &#8217; re seeing at the moment. It seems that more of us need to go back to our ivory towers. That in no way precludes a better dialogue with society.</span></td>

<td><span style="font-size:9.25pt;">On the whole, yes, although we really need more incentives and support, and less meddling. These constant calls for greater internationalism are quite naive. The natural sciences and engineering were the first, and the broadest, global business, a business that &#8217; s always been judged by global standards &#8211; or at least the good ones have been. This internationalism is one of the major differences between science and politics: Science truly puts it into practice, while politics gets tied up in treaties and agreements. Good scientists are welcome everywhere they go, and they take full advantage of this. The less good ones should first stay home and do their homework. They &#8217; re not going to get better by going abroad. &lt;</span></td>

In a parallel development, Major observed that the huge poverty gap that exists between the industrialized nations and the developing world must be bridged. Most telling of all in this regard is the fact that 3 billion people are forced to live on less than 2 dollars a day, he says.

Even so, 57 percent of the Swiss are worried about losing their jobs, the relatively high youth unemployment rate, and the difference between the unemployment fi gures for German-speaking Switzerland and the numbers for the French- and Italian-speaking parts of the country.</span></td>

Asking respondents to state their fi ve key concerns, the representative poll carried out by the research institute gfs. bern found, however, that the percentages for the top three worries were on average 10 percent lower than in 2006.

<td><span style="font-size:9pt;">The relationship between the Swiss and the country &#8217; s foreign population is constantly under debate. Is Switzerland, a country dependent on skilled personnel from abroad, facing the threat of being overrun by foreigners? What approach should be taken to refugees and asylum seekers? The discussion has taken on a new dimension in the wake of an increase in violent crime largely attributable to poorly integrated foreigners. Although the situation in Switzerland is not dramatic compared to most other countries, concerns for personal safety were still voiced by almost one-third of those polled. The Worry Barometer survey gives no grounds for assuming that attitudes towards foreigners will be any better in 10 years. That said, only 3 percent of respondents believe that future generations will actually suffer from the high proportion of foreign nationals.</span></td>

Having more or less disappeared out of the Worry Barometer &#8217; s range for a number of years, the environment is a cause of concern to as many as one-quarter of the population in 2007. Environmental destruction thus ranks eighth behind &#8220; new poverty,&#8221; which affects a sizeable proportion of the population even in Switzerland. The survey also provides an indication of the extent to which the population trusts &#8211; or mistrusts &#8211; the various institutions. The improved economic situation prompted a year-on-year increase in virtually all confidence figures. Leading the trust stakes are the Federal Court, the police and, for the second time in succession, the banks. Sixty percent of the Swiss say they trust the banks. When the economy was not faring so well, the fi gure was less than 40 percent. Trust in political bodies such as the Federal Council and parliament may have suffered a slight blow, but there are no grounds even for these institutions to be dissatisfi ed, especially when compared with the political parties and the mass media.</span></td>

This is based in part on a general public misconception of the banks &#8217; achievements in these areas.

The very fact that Tutankhamun lay undisturbed for 35 centuries is testament to this desire to secure peace and prosperity after death. As Hawass explains: &#8220; It was the dream of every ancient Egyptian to keep his tomb hidden for eternal life.&#8221; No part of the exhibition exemplifies this cultural sensitivity better than the dark walls of the room wherein the burnished coffi n of Tjuya lies. Several of the earlier rooms are lighter in color. In contrast, this room is black as night, save the spotlights on her grave goods. One is reminded of the contrast between sombre death and the role of splendid goods in defeating it.</span></td>

There is no ribbing and planks to these boats but they are elegant and swift. The seats for oarsmen on deck and all other woodwork have been constructed entirely without metal joins or bracing. They are single-masted. One minor complaint regarding labeling is that visitors are only told that the material is wood. We have no idea which particular type of wood the Ancient Egyptians preferred for their boat-building or indeed any other ornament. Of other materials, most of the statues are in polished grey granite, which makes them darkly imposing under the spotlights. Canopic jars and oil-bearing vessels are in a pale orange admixture of glass and calcite. There are also many smaller objects, including delicately-painted faience pomegranates and other fruit, in startling turquoise. Turquoise itself, the darker blue of lapis lazuli and dun red carnelian appear in elaborate chains of jewelry. These would be worn on the chest of the deceased to ease their passage in the afterlife, just as the bright blue fruit would magically provide sustenance after death.</span></td>

Mobile phones don &#8217; t do this &#8211; homeless people lose them easily, or have them stolen, or they run out of credit &#8211; and a landline number gives a greater sense of stability to potential employers than a mobile number.&#8221;</span></td>

From that aspect, we determine what the biggest issues are in regard to access to education and literacy. Once those issues are determined, we fi nd the best proven ways to address them through partnerships with innovative charities. In East London, truancy and exclusion from the formal school system is one of many hurdles these families face. We are working with charities that help to get those children back into school. This is important because with every year of education, employment opportunities increase along with many other positive causal affects, such as better health and birth rates. Educating the children in the community is also good for business in the very long term, because these children are our future employees, and ideally, our future clients.</span></td>

Getting to that point was, however, a big endeavor. As with all other Credit Suisse teams across the country organizing a Soup Day, the budget for Rapperswil was just enough to provide the basics, and so the organizers had to look for more sponsors. The Rapperswil team was also faced with the fact that the public in this region was unfamiliar with Soup Day. &#8220; We had to get the public relations wheel turning and that was time-consuming,&#8221; Lutz recalls. &#8220; Luckily we gained the support of our local radio station, which broadcast commercials for free and later also reported from the site.&#8221; Another important sponsor was the restaurant Villa Aurum, a top-notch restaurant.

The road will be bumpy, with setbacks and new challenges not even on the radar from today &#8217; s vantage point. Nevertheless, health sciences will inevitably become more interlinked with nanotechnology and computer science. New forms of collaboration will emerge that reap benefits from different disciplines even faster. Dialog and consensus across borders will also become more important. For those who understand the relevant drivers behind these trends and their implications this presents significant opportunities. Revolutionary change in the health sciences might not come as quickly as futurists believe, but society should prepare now as if it would. &lt;</span></td>

Together, the two German automakers are working on a hybrid solution which could well be groundbreaking for further development work. In order to survive in an increasingly demanding global market environment, luxury car makers also have to network more and, wherever possible, take advantage of cost synergies without having to relinquish their autonomy as a result. The market is polarized with luxury automakers on one side, and low-cost cars the likes of Renault &#8217; s Logan on the other. In the lowprice segment, profits rest with mass production as margins have become infi nitesimally small, with the exception of the replacement parts business. It &#8217; s possible to earn decent margins in the luxury segment as long as quality and exclusivity are guaranteed. &lt;</span></td>
