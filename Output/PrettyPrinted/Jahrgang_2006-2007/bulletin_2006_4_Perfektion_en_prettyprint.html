<td><span style="font-size:9.25pt;">For me as an artist, there are various ways of interpreting and representing the same subject, depending on my disposition and feeling. Every interpretation can be inimitable and of the highest quality. That is also true of the Sino-Japanese characters, the kanjis. It is similar to music, where you can perform and interpret the same notes time and again, but each time in a dif ferent way. Depending on the situation and requirements, the individual lines of the characters can be represented softly and flexibly or strongly and rather statically, but also lushly or dryly, effusively or eco no m- ically, delicately or opulently. You can express feelings and nuances very well with the shades of ink that can be produced &#8211; be tween pale grey and saturated black. For Western eyes, these subtle differences are scarcely identifiable; Westerners probably see calli graphy as abstract works of art.</span></td>

<tr>
<td><span style="font-size:9.25pt;">In the long history of Chinese characters there have been many great artists who have set standards. There is good and bad calli g- raphy, but in art there is no perfection. Art cannot be measured. In my opinion, perfection would in any case be too sterile. The only thing that matters to me is whether I am satisfied with my work myself, whether I have been able to realize my ideas in it, and whether it expresses precisely what I would like it to.</span></td>

<tr>
<td><span style="font-size:9.25pt;">Of course, it is important to have a command of calligraphic principles. There are clearly defined rules and precepts, but it takes patience to attain Sosh&#251; and Soko, the Japanese and Chinese master titles. If you like, this can be associated with perfection &#8211; or simply with precision. Add one more little line, and the character can mean something entirely different. In artistic calligraphy the basic framework of the characters must also be correct. We don &#8217; t use fantasy characters; the strokes always have a specific meaning. Nonetheless, there is still scope for several artistic nuances.</span></td>

<td><span style="font-size:9.25pt;">In our way of thinking, which is reflected in calligraphy, Tao (&#8220; the way &#8221;) and Zen play an important role, although not in the Buddhist, but in the traditional sense. Our entire way of thinking and feeling is influenced by it. One of my works is called &#8220; Clouds Move On, Water Flows.&#8221; Nature does not stand still; there is movement everywhere. In Japanese there is no word for &#8220; to have,&#8221; only for &#8220; to hold for a moment.&#8221; However, change is not a matter of chance. Water must ebb, clouds must move on. Those are their attributes, their reason for existing. We don &#8217; t talk about &#8220; progress,&#8221; but &#8220; development.&#8221; Those who develop blossom, yet at the same time they become themselves to an ever greater extent. In the West people strive for perfection. Making mistakes is not allowed. We also work toward achieving an objective, but we can also accept it when things turn out differently. We can accept our weaknesses. Not only perfection exists, but also imperfection. Incidentally, my name &#8211; &#8220; Sanae &#8221; &#8211; means &#8220; the little rice sower.&#8221; The seed should grow, but the ripe grain of rice modestly bows its head toward the earth. &lt;</span></td>

The subject of the photo is irrelevant, what &#8217; s important is how it &#8217; s behaving. I &#8217; ve had the pleasure of photographing a baby Flamboyant Cuttlefish wiggling within its opalescent egg, and just moments later captured its first swim. I even watched this tiny creature slip from its egg, but was so awed by the moment that I didn &#8217; t press the shutter button, missing what could have been the perfect photo.</span></td>

He knows exactly how light and water interplay, which is a true gift in an environment where the natural light lessens and even disappears with depth. And, there is the issue of color. The oceans are rich with fishes and creatures with bold colors that are visible to the eye, but most digital camera sensors can &#8217; t pick them up. The first color to go after a few feet is red and with more depth, all that is left is blue. Strobes are needed to saturate the photo, but as with terrestrial photography, knowing where to place the light is key. And, finally, there is talent, for which even top-of-the-line equipment can &#8217; t compensate.</span></td>

The best place for muck &#8211; and therefore a premiere destination for macro photographers &#8211; is the Lembeh Strait, a marine sanctuary sheltered between the North Sulawesi Peninsula of central Indonesia and the narrow island of Lembeh. The straight is situated so that it forms a bottleneck that fills with a rich supply of plankton that is then trapped there by the prevailing currents. This results in &#8220; muck,&#8221; or murky water, low visibility and sadly some rubbish that has drifted in, but also a wide and weird variety of miniscule creatures, like the adorable Pygmy Seahorse that is no more than</span></td>

Whether they have five or five hundred petals is irrelevant; what matters is that the plant should be elegant. When growing roses, you can &#8217; t just combine beautiful blooms and beautiful leaves; they have to be right as an entity. Magnificent components don &#8217; t necessarily make for a magnificent plant &#8211; that frequently offends my aesthetic sensibilities.

There was a time when pale pastels were all the rage; then the stronger colors came back in. Only one color never goes out of fashion, and that &#8217; s red, because it symbolizes love. And finally, the scent of a rose is very important. Clients often come into our garden, push their noses right up against the rose, inhale the scent, and then they smile.

The environment among the world &#8217; s elite is tough and the road to perfection a hard one to navigate &#8211; for coaches and athletes alike. Every week, the team completes ten training sessions in the water, two sessions of power training, and two sessions of running. Widmer makes notes, analyzes, and meticulously registers every detail that can contribute to a more perfect performance &#8211; whether it be his athletes &#8217; sleeping patterns or problems at school.

It relieves the pressure of expectation brought on by striving for the perfect performance.&#8221; The coach remains calm and considered. Swearing is taboo; criticism constructive. The team grows together in its pursuit of perfection &#8211; and Widmer provides the necessary impetus. He is in turn a dictator, a colleague, and an opponent. What Widmer always remains is a confi dant. He is convinced that &#8220; good performances are possible only if a relationship of trust exists between coach and athlete.&#8221; He also thinks that the perfect coach-athlete relationship does not exist &#8211; the athletes and their life situations are too diverse for that to be possible. In interpersonal relations he fi nds harmony rather than perfection to be important &#8211; and perhaps it is precisely this factor that turns good swimmers into world champions. &lt;</span></td>

The Englishman William Stanley Jevons, the Austrian Carl Menger, and the Frenchman L&#233;on Walras each set out independently to develop a model to describe how a perfectly functioning market would deliver maximum efficiency to the economy, an idea that gave birth to the neoclassical school of economics. For decades, liberal economic policy-makers were striving to harness this ideal &#8211; only to realize that a complex reality refused to be squeezed into the mold of a theory. Their basic assumptions proved to be too rigid: Perfect and complete information, rational behavior of market players, equal market access, fixed levels of techno logy, homogenous goods, the absence of transaction costs, and an atomistic market structure in which none of the many small-scale producers can influence a standard price that is determined solely by supply and demand interacting.</span></td>

Or, take market entry barriers: Setting up a web site is a lot cheaper than setting up a business in physical form. Or, take transaction costs: Buyers and sellers can complete transactions online within seconds, irrespective of time or location. Or, take atomistic market structure: The Internet as a global market place allows a huge number of buyers and sellers to interact. &#8220; It was only logical to conclude,&#8221; says Hasfeld, &#8220; that this would bring about a situation in which competition on the Internet would inten sify, ultimately leading to lower and more standardized prices.&#8221;</span></td>

And there is an additional aspect with which the Internet has failed to live up to the expectations of its proponents: Markets rarely end up with a standard price, and even after the introduction of the Internet, consumers continue to pay different amounts for the same item, depending on the seller or the region.

Here, economists refer to the phenomenon that sets in when the value of goods increases in proportion with the number of people who use them. The telephone serves as the best example in that a phone would be of little use to someone who was the sole owner. Hasfeld has observed network effects in the Internet as well: &#8220; Be it in job, real estate, or automobile exchanges, the following seems to hold: The more participating suppliers there are, the more choice visitors to such sites will have.&#8221; With this, a situation is destined to arise in which the market will sooner or later see a single main player emerge that can offer its buyers the broadest range of options. According to Hasfeld, an additional phenomenon kicks in that further leverages the clout of online Goliaths: &#8220; When online, buyers are literally blinded by the flood of information they &#8217; re exposed to, and therefore prefer to orient themselves by the major and well-known names. This means that, on the Internet, reputation plays an even larger role than it does in physical markets.&#8221; And reputation is in turn the fruit of the initial network effect &#8211; a by-product of large numbers of users flocking to a particular provider.

The fallout? Probably not as much as appears at first sight. Perfect or not, the Internet has bestowed a wealth of favors on consumers so far. Even critic Peter Hasfeld concedes that &#8220; there is a huge amount of choice out there and it &#8217; s possible to find truly bizarre items on the Internet.&#8221; He prefers, however, to spend most of his day offline. For one thing, his travel office around the corner always manages to find a cheaper offer than what is available on the Internet. At the moment, the quasimonopolist eBay is the only digital iron he has in the fire. His shopping list reads: &#8220; Sporting goods and clothing.&#8221; &lt;</span></td>

The concentration of creative forces is what makes Como such an interesting location for auto designers specializing in interiors. &#8220; Northern Italy is a melting pot for design, especially furniture and fashion,&#8221; explains Weber. &#8220; Of course, cycles for furniture are much shorter than for cars, but they do indicate the direction trends are headed.&#8221; He views the fashion shows held in Milan each year as a lightning rod for creativity. Another advantage is the proximity to Turin.

This means 34,000 opportunities for meeting clients &#8217; needs, as Hanspeter Kurzmeyer, Head of Private Clients Switzerland, likes to emphasize. This was the reason behind the launch of the Branch Excellence initiative, which can be summarized in the words &#8220; modern, inviting, personal.&#8221; The initiative aims to provide a uniform image for the branches and a fi rst-class customer service. Clients are welcomed in person by the fl oor manager and, depending on their needs, either receive active advice or are referred onward. The initiative was launched on February 28, 2005, by the B&#252;lach branch (reported in Bulletin). Since then, 15 Credit Suisse locations have been redesigned accordingly, including Zermatt, Aarau, Zurich- Rathausplatz, and Lausanne Lion d &#8217; Or. And another seven branches will follow by the end of the year: Effretikon, Interlaken, Zurich-Werdm&#252;hleplatz (see picture above), Thalwil, Horgen, Neuch&#226;tel, and Yverdon.</span></td>

Membership of this circle comprises historic and modern gardens, as well as gardens designed by individual artists. Established as a private initiative in 1997, it now counts 64 gardens among its collection, all of which are open to the public. In recent years, the gardens have made a signifi cant contribution to the spread of a new kind of tourism, specializing in the discovery of botanic masterpieces. The impetus for the &#8220; Great Gardens of Italy &#8221; initiative comes directly from the owners of these works of art, some of which are over 500 years old and are distributed across the whole of Italy, from Lombardy to Sicily. The initiative deserves support not only due to the beauty of these gems of landscaping and architecture, but above all because of the enthusiasm with which the owners share their passion with the public.</span></td>

So, the chess event organized by Credit Suisse and its former director-general, William Wirth, has come along just at the right moment for him. During the grandmasters &#8217; tournament he plays lightning chess with Swiss master Florian Jenni. In the ensuing simultaneous match, he has the honor of competing against Gary Kasparov, who was chess world champion from 1985 to 2000. In the opinion of the many onlookers, he gives an excellent account of himself in defeat. Self-critically, Nico admits he had hopes of gaining a draw. As did three-time seniors &#8217; champion, Dragomir Vucenovic.</span></td>

The prime aim is to teach young musicians the real-life challenges of the job. This is important, since universities usually turn out graduates who have proved their worth only in the university environment.</span></td>

Following its successful exhibitions of major works from the Philipps Collection in Washington and the Moscow Pushkin Museum, 50 major European paintings owned by the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art (Met) will be on display until November 12. This museum, founded in 1870, possesses around 2,500 works by important European masters that were donated mainly by private individuals. The exhibition therefore also conveys something about the taste of American art collectors, as well as the current Met expert for European art, Katherine Baetjer. It is pleasing to note that, alongside Klimt, Courbet, Pissarro, Gauguin, Renoir, Degas, Goya, El Greco, van Gogh, van Dyck and many others, the only woman to be included in the exhibition &#8211; and deservedly so &#8211; is Swiss artist Angelika Kaufmann. Considering that the Met owns 37 Monets, 21 C&#233;zannes and 15 Rembrandts, it is fascinating to consider why a particular work was selected to represent the respective artist. Later on, therefore, it &#8217; s worth visiting www.metmuseum.org or, still better, the Met itself.</span></td>

Gerstl left the institution to enter the somewhat more progressive school run by Heinrich Leffl er. However, his refusal to take part in a formal procession in honor of the Emperor Franz Josef because he found it &#8220; unworthy of an artist &#8221; &#8211; understandable from today &#8217; s perspective &#8211; caused another rupture.

He spent the summers of 1907 and 1908 with the Sch&#246;nberg family in Traunstein near Gmunden and gave Arnold Sch&#246;nberg drawing lessons. His passion for Mathilde Sch&#246;nberg, who left her family for him, led to a rift with the composer, who was in the midst of working on his Second Concerto for Strings.

India also has huge strength in the pharmaceutical sector. It is also fast becoming a global hub in the automotive industry. Of course, the health sector is also becoming more interesting. Not only in the sense that India is working closely with American hospitals, but also in the sense that we supply a medical workforce for which there is a global demand. On a recent trip to the United States, I was told the country will need about 2 million paramedics by 2015. Where will they come from? India. So, there are requirements for huge training centers for paramedics.</span></td>

However, the implementation of new positioning strategies frequently requires considerable capital involving a heightened level of risk, which often cannot be covered entirely using equity (additional investments, cash flow, retained profits) and traditional loans. Due to increasing competition, companies are facing the challenge of tapping alternative sources to complement traditional financing tools (equity and loans) in order to exploit business and growth opportunities by means of a well-balanced financing mix while maintaining their scope for financial maneuver.</span></td>

This approach enables the company to finance its investments entirely through debt financing. The primary focus here is on the aspect of utilization rather than ownership of the goods.

This is applied to goods that are newly leased at frequent intervals. With fi nancial leasing, the duration is usually determined according to the economic and technical life expectancy of the object. It is also characteristic of this fi nancing instrument that the lessee has no option to terminate the agreement during the term of the contract, and that he bears both the investment risk and the obligation to maintain the object. The contract frequently also provides for a purchase option at a residual value determined in advance. In this sense, fi nancial leasing is similar to hire purchase.</span></td>

Liquid funds are thus available for other operational processes and business projects.</span></td>

For example, when the contract is concluded, the leasing installments can be adjusted to a large extent to the revenue that the leased property is expected to earn, according to the &#8220; pay-asyou-earn principle.&#8221; However, the &#8220; pay-asyou-earn effect &#8221; cannot disguise the fact that leasing payments are a fixed overhead that must first be earned.

Thanks to its high level of precision, quality and productivity, a medium-sized mechanical engineering company has successfully asserted itself in the market against international competition. Among other things, it uses expensive, high-grade checking and measuring devices. Rapid technical progress and the growing demands of its clients mean that the devices have to be replaced at increasingly frequent intervals. New checking and measuring systems are just about to be launched on the market, but the company cannot afford to wait. It could finance the purchase of the urgently needed device off its own bat, or fall back on its house bank &#8217; s credit facilities. However, the company faces the question of whether it should invest its funds in the acquisition of such a device &#8211; which will still be serviceable in a few years, but no longer technically up to date &#8211; and thus enter into a long-term commitment. Depending on the device &#8217; s operating life expectancy and amortization with appropriate provision for termination and residual value, both financial and operating leasing can offer adequate solutions. On the one hand, it offers the company the opportunity to use the measuring device without buying it, and secondly to switch over to the new technology as soon as it is ready for the market without sustaining major financial losses. On the other hand, the company can keep its equity capital free for forward-looking projects, such as new developments or expansionary measures.</span></td>

The work represents an impressive and informative contribution to a subject that always fuels fresh debate. It also makes an interesting read and, in passing, provides background economic information; the reader gains an overview of the global cotton and textile industry.

The hardliners have been attacking some of the bank chiefs who want to further deregulate the banking sector. They argue that if you go on relaxing the state &#8217; s power over the economy, sooner or later, the party won &#8217; t be able to control the state. That &#8217; s true. As another tipping point, people have overused the metaphor that China is like an elephant on a bicycle that has to go on pedaling in order to promote social stability and avoid breakdown. That too requires continuing economic change and reform. There are really two tipping points, a political one and an economic one.

Although those changes were rolled back after the handover, Chris Patten still believes that Hong Kong will eventually be democratic. Upon his return to the United Kingdom, he was appointed Chairman of the Independent Com mission on Policing for Northern Ireland set up under the Good Friday Agreement. From 1999 to 2004, the trained historian served as European Commissioner for External Relations, and in 2005, he was elevated to the peerage, becoming Lord Patten of Barnes.

I was recently in the Middle East and was struck by the way authoritarian governments breed terrorism. Authoritarian governments don &#8217; t produce the economic policies that create growth and jobs. They create the resentment of repression. The most dangerous incubator for political extremism is unemployment and police repression. We don &#8217; t understand the dynamics of political Islam, and by trying to repress it, are turning it into jihadist Islam.</span></td>

Europe has lived since the last World War in Pax Americana rather comfortably, which has given the Americans a different perspective on things. And, America is more obviously religious, which affects its politics. The truth is that the world needs a strong, self-confident and effective America. The result of the policy it has pursued in the last few years has weakened it and encouraged many Americans to turn on themselves. We haven &#8217; t particularly helped that in Europe.</span></td>
