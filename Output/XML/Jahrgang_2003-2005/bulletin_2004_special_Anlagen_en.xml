    <div> Why emerging markets ?</div>
    <div> Emerging markets are countries undergoing a phase of economic transformation . This process generates a range of opportunities and risks that are economic , societal , and political in nature . The sooner investors analyze such developments , the greater the potential returns that can be achieved in these markets . In the current environment marked by relatively modest growth in the large industrialized economies , successful investors will have no alternative in the future to devoting more attention to emerging markets .</div>
    <div> The latest group of countries to join the European Union</div>
    <div> ( EU )</div>
    <div> represents one cluster of emerging markets . Considering the economic progress achieved by previous emerging-market countries such as Ireland , Spain and Greece , one can imagine the potential these new</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> member states represent .</div>
    <div> Various factors are likely to contribute to above-average economic momentum in these countries in the next few years , and it goes without saying that investors stand to profit from this development . Some examples :</div>
    <div> p</div>
    <div> Salary costs that are up to</div>
    <div> 80</div>
    <div> percent lower and scaled-back capital-transfer</div>
    <div> controls will stimulate foreign investment and boost profit margins in labor-intensive industries in the foreseeable future .</div>
    <div> p</div>
    <div> If interest rates in these countries continue to fall to</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> levels , saving will become an unattractive option and consumer spending will be stimulated .</div>
    <div> p</div>
    <div> Inclusion of local stock exchanges in international indices will automatically result in passive capital flows from indexed funds and institutional investors .</div>
    <div> p</div>
    <div> The Ifo Institute expects growth rates in the new</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> member states to be twice as high as growth in the</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> overall over the next few years ; in view of the lower historical basis for growth , this projection is entirely realistic .</div>
    <div> In addition , the price corrections in emerging market investments in the spring represent a welcome remedy to the overheating that had set in during the months before . This correction is a good reason to re-examine emerging markets , hence this special issue of Bulletin dedicated to this exciting topic . We hope you enjoy reading our analyses .</div>

    <div> INVESTMENTS</div>
    <div> �</div>
    <div> For many investors , the concept of emerging markets conjures up images of financial and currency crises , unstable political systems and floundering equity prices . Between</div>
    <div> 1990</div>
    <div> and</div>
    <div> 2002</div>
    <div> , Swiss equities produced an annual return of</div>
    <div> 13</div>
    <div> percent with market volatility of</div>
    <div> 23</div>
    <div> percent . In the same period , the performance of equities in emerging market countries was just</div>
    <div> 7</div>
    <div> percent with volatility of</div>
    <div> 29</div>
    <div> percent ; investors would have been better off with Swiss equities . As is so often the case , however , past performance is not a reliable indicator of the future . Morgan Stanley ’ s</div>
    <div> MSCI</div>
    <div> Emerging Markets Index , for example , has risen by more than</div>
    <div> 40</div>
    <div> percent since May</div>
    <div> 2003</div>
    <div> (</div>
    <div> MSCI</div>
    <div> Emerging Markets standard annualized historical returns , local currency ). Asia in particular has generated spectacular growth : indices in some emerging markets in this region have risen by more than</div>
    <div> 100</div>
    <div> percent , depending on market and period .</div>
    <div> Steady inflows of foreign direct investment have proven remarkably resilient to crises .</div>
    <div> Excesses have been corrected</div>
    <div> Of course , it would be a mistake to base one ’ s entire portfolio on emerging markets . Under current economic conditions , a certain amount of caution is advisable in this regard . Periods of more restrictive</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> monetary policy – such as is anticipated over the next six to nine months – are typically associated with belowaverage performance in emerging markets . Long-term opportunities for good returns , however , remain intact . The financial and economic crises have brought about a fundamental structural correction . Old-boy networks linking politics , financial systems , and industry are no longer as common in many regions , and the banking system has been purged of its debt excesses . This has created an environment for healthier growth . In Korea , for example , the banking system has been restructured and re-capitalized over a period of four years , and Central and Eastern European countries have introduced structural reforms that</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> member states such as Germany and France are only now starting to consider after great hesitation .</div>
    <div> Foreign lenders and domestic companies and governments in the emerging market regions have learned their lesson . In addition , the increased macroeconomic stability and the cost advantages offered by emerging market countries have secured a steady inflow of foreign direct investment to these regions since about the mid-1990s . These inflows have proven remarkably resilient to crises and currently constitute the largest share of net capital inflows .</div>
    <div> Another important reason for investing in the equity markets of emerging market countries is the strong economic growth they are experiencing . In addition to foreign direct investment , one of the primary driving forces behind this growth is the rising level of prosperity among the populations of these countries . The demographic component further enhances the attractiveness of emerging markets , as the rapidly deteriorating situation in industrialized countries in general , and Europe in particular , is impairing the growth potential of their equity markets . Populations in emerging market countries are not only generally younger , they are also increasingly well educated . Once stable political conditions are the order of the day and sensible economic policies are pursued , the inherent growth potential will be fully exploitable . This will also promote the emergence of a middle class , which is likely to become a significant growth factor due to rising levels of prosperity .</div>
    <div> Relapses are unlikely today</div>
    <div> The next ten to fifteen years will be characterized by accelerated industrialization in the emerging market regions . This will result in a growing demand for raw materials and energy supplies . Commodity exporting countries such as Canada , Russia , South Africa and Brazil are likely to benefit from this development . The trend towards globalization and growing acceptance of market economy principles in countries such as China and India should also help to prevent a recurrence of the turbulence seen in the</div>
    <div> 1990s</div>
    <div> . Local crises are possible , but the runaway fires of the</div>
    <div> 1990s</div>
    <div> are much less likely today .</div>
    <div> ❙</div>
    <div> Defining “ emerging markets ”</div>
    <div> There is no “ official ” definition of what constitutes an emerging market . As a rule , the term</div>
    <div> refers to countries that have underdeveloped financial infrastructures but the potential for</div>
    <div> economic growth . The World Bank sets an upper limit of</div>
    <div> USD 9,656</div>

    <div heading="article"> The enlargement continues</div>
    <div> The biggest enlargement ever of the European Union (</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> ) has just been completed , but the real work is only just getting under way . The new</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> member states must prepare for adopting the euro and fresh candidates are already waiting in the wings .</div>
    <div> Hans-Peter Wäfler , Economic &amp; Policy Consulting</div>
    <div> �</div>
    <div> The May Day holiday this year gave special cause for celebration in much of Europe . On May</div>
    <div> 1 , 2004</div>
    <div> , ten countries joined the</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> , most of them former East Block countries . Celebrations at the official enlargement ceremony also marked the reunification of East and West . May</div>
    <div> 1</div>
    <div> was a historic occasion , but the festivities were only a brief intermezzo in the much larger project that is underway . Joschka Fischer , Germany ’ s foreign minister , emphasized this a few days later in his speech on Europe delivered in Zurich : “ It will take some time to work through the enlargement process .”</div>
    <div> No time for a breather , there ’ s work to do . A further step for the new member states will be the introduction of the European single currency , the euro . They are not yet members of European Monetary Union (</div>
    <div> EMU</div>
    <div> ), but as members of the</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> , they are obliged to prepare for adopting the euro . For the new member states , there is no opt-out clause such as that of the</div>
    <div> UK</div>
    <div> and Denmark giving them the right to remain outside</div>
    <div> EMU</div>
    <div> permanently .</div>
    <div> A question of pace</div>
    <div> The accession states did not request an optout clause anyway . On the contrary . They hope that the euro will provide additional support to their rapidly expanding economies ( see graph on page</div>
    <div> 11</div>
    <div> ). Although all ten countries joined the</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> at the same time , they will not reach the finishing line for adopting the euro together . Each country will approach</div>
    <div> EMU</div>
    <div> at its own pace , and each will be assessed individually . The basis for this assessment is the Maastricht convergence criteria : solid public finances , low inflation , low interest rates and two years of stable exchange rates versus the euro within the framework of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (</div>
    <div> ERM 2</div>
    <div> ). The normal bandwidth tolerance is plus or minus</div>
    <div> 15</div>
    <div> percent ; however , a smaller margin may be prescribed for individual countries . The exchange rate criterion requires that at least two years must elapse between accession to the</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> and joining</div>
    <div> EMU</div>
    <div> . This means that the enlargement of</div>
    <div> EMU</div>
    <div> is unlikely to move off the drawing board before</div>
    <div> 2007</div>
    <div> at the earliest .</div>
    <div> Not all of the new accession states will be ready this early , and some countries will not</div>
    <div> Dynamic economies</div>
    <div> The ten accession countries are enjoying faster economic growth than the older EU members . Central and Eastern Europe has developed into Europe ’ s most dynamic economic region .</div>

    <div> want to adopt the euro this soon . Each new</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> member state faces the difficulty of finding the right pace for the euro convergence process . Entry into</div>
    <div> EMU</div>
    <div> will see a lowering of transaction costs for trade with other</div>
    <div> EMU</div>
    <div> members , but at the same time those countries involved must give up their independent monetary policy and flexible exchange rates , and this at a time when their economies are in a phase of catching up . Higher economic growth tends to result in higher inflation , while an ongoing need for substantial investment makes it more difficult to consolidate public finances .</div>
    <div> The first countries to be ready for the euro are likely to be the smaller accession states . For example , Lithuania and Estonia meet most of the convergence criteria already ( see table below ). The euro timetable will be more unpredictable for the three largest new member states in the group : Poland , the Czech Republic and Hungary in particular will face a challenge when it comes to reining in their government deficits . These countries will probably only be ready to join</div>
    <div> EMU</div>
    <div> around the end of the decade . The Czech Republic aims to introduce the euro by</div>
    <div> 2009</div>
    <div> or</div>
    <div> 2010</div>
    <div> . Against a background of still only partial fulfillment of the convergence criteria , the European Central Bank (</div>
    <div> ECB</div>
    <div> ) itself has warned against hasty entry to the</div>
    <div> ERM 2</div>
    <div> , the anteroom of</div>
    <div> EMU</div>
    <div> . Jean-Claude Trichet , President of the</div>
    <div> ECB</div>
    <div> ,</div>
    <div> “ Our objective is to create a league of friendship stretching from Russia to Morocco .”</div>
    <div> Romano Prodi , President of the European Commission</div>
    <div> has stated that countries must undergo “ greater political adjustment , for example price liberalization and credible plans for consolidating state finances ” before they can join the exchange rate mechanism . The first convergence report by the</div>
    <div> ECB</div>
    <div> examining preparations for the euro in the accession countries is due to be published in October</div>
    <div> 2004</div>
    <div> .</div>
    <div> Old and new EU aspirants</div>
    <div> The end of the year , however , will not only see the release of important news for the euro hopefuls . There is also excitement in the candidate countries that have not yet attained full membership : Bulgaria , Romania and Turkey . In fall</div>
    <div> 2004</div>
    <div> , the European Commission will release its annual interim report on the candidate countries . Bulgaria and Romania are hoping for the green light in favor of</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> accession in</div>
    <div> 2007</div>
    <div> . The report will also serve as the basis for an</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> decision on whether or not to begin actual membership negotiations with Turkey . Any negotiations can be expected to drag on for several years .</div>
    <div> Other countries may accede to the</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> before Turkey makes it over the finishing line . Membership applications have been received from Croatia and Macedonia . In the case of Croatia , the Commission has already recommended opening negotiations . This has been seen as a signal that the future of the Balkans will also lie within the</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> .</div>
    <div> However , the</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> is more hesitant when it comes to countries further east and south . The outgoing President of the European Commission , Romano Prodi , commented as follows during his speech about enlargement on May</div>
    <div> 1 , 2004</div>
    <div> : “ Our objective is to create a league of friendship from Russia to Morocco .” To a certain degree , this would represent “ a different kind of enlargement concept – enlargement without participation in our institutions ”, integration that would not necessarily lead to</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> membership . A growing</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> is trying to find its limits without creating new divisions in Europe .</div>
    <div> ❙</div>
    <div> Conditions for introducing the euro</div>
    <div> Like the founding members of European Monetary Union , the new accession states must meet the Maastricht convergence criteria before they can adopt the euro .</div>

    <div heading="article"> The tortuous road to the euro</div>
    <div> Currency developments in the new</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> member states depend on macroeconomic and political stability , as well as a credible monetary policy . Investors should therefore look beyond the interest rate advantage offered by these currencies .</div>
    <div> Marcus Hettinger , Forex Analysis &amp; Strategy</div>
    <div> �</div>
    <div> In the last few years , hopes for rapid accession to the</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> have led to a convergence in interest rate levels . This is because entry to the eurozone and adoption of the euro make it likely that local interest rates will move closer to interest rates in the</div>
    <div> EU 12</div>
    <div> . The yield differential between government bonds denominated in local currencies and German government bonds has contracted . Interest rates higher than those in the eurozone increase the attractiveness of local bond markets , but , in considering the total yield , investors should not lose sight of currency fluctuations . The last two years have shown that Eastern European currencies are prone to significant fluctuations which can eliminate the positive yield on bonds entirely .</div>
    <div> Over a longer period of five years , the Polish zloty (</div>
    <div> PLN</div>
    <div> ) and Hungarian forint (</div>
    <div> HUF</div>
    <div> ) lost about</div>
    <div> 15</div>
    <div> and</div>
    <div> 5</div>
    <div> percent respectively against the euro ( see graph ). By contrast , the Czech koruna (</div>
    <div> CZK</div>
    <div> ) and Slovakian koruna (</div>
    <div> SKK</div>
    <div> ) rose by</div>
    <div> 7</div>
    <div> and</div>
    <div> 5</div>
    <div> percent respectively . In the short term , however , the currencies have been subject to much greater fluctuations . The zloty , forint and Czech koruna have depreciated significantly against the euro since the start of</div>
    <div> 2002</div>
    <div> . One reason for the devaluation is probably the euro ’ s strength during this period . However , domestic economic factors also play an important role in the performance of currencies , and investors should not forget this .</div>
    <div> a government to rein in its spending , are equally important . A factor closely related to government budget deficits is the significant increase in some balance of payments deficits that has also been a feature of recent years . A balance of payments deficit is the result of domestic public and private savings levels being insufficient to finance investments . The deficit must be financed by foreign capital inflows ( direct investment or portfolio inflows in the form of bonds and equities ). Portfolio inflows in particular respond rapidly to changes in the macroeconomic or political environment and therefore have a greater impact on currencies . The size of the balance of payments deficit and the structure of financing therefore play a decisive role in currency performance .</div>
    <div> In addition to fiscal policy , the credibility of a country ’ s monetary policy plays a central role . Some countries set inflation targets and accept currency fluctuations as a fact of life ( Poland , for example ). Once a country joins the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (</div>
    <div> ERM 2</div>
    <div> ), however , the primary objective of monetary policy becomes the stabilization of the exchange rate within the</div>
    <div> ERM 2</div>
    <div> bandwidths .</div>
    <div> Exchange rate policy dominates</div>
    <div> The European currency system crises of</div>
    <div> 1992</div>
    <div> ( Italy , the</div>
    <div> UK</div>
    <div> and Sweden ) should serve to remind us that , following entry into</div>
    <div> ERM 2</div>
    <div> , domestic economic objectives ( fiscal and employment policies , etc .) take second ranking behind exchange rate policy in order to avoid major disruptions in the financial markets . Investors should not overlook the fact that the currencies of the accession states can still experience considerable fluctuations against the euro within the</div>
    <div> ERM 2</div>
    <div> bandwidths .</div>
    <div> ❙</div>
    <div> Large exchange rate fluctuations</div>
    <div> While the forint and the zloty have fallen against the euro in recent years , the Czech and Slovakian koruna are stronger today than they were in 1999.</div>

    <div> The budget position has worsened over the past few years . Rising deficits in government budgets lead to more government bond issues , which in turn tends to drive interest rates higher .

  </article>
  <article n="7">
    <div heading="article"> EU</div>
  </article>
  <article n="8">
    <div heading="article"> must proceed boldly ”</div>
    <div> The former German foreign minister , Hans-Dietrich Genscher , is convinced that eastward enlargement of the</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> is a historic milestone , not an end in itself .</div>
    <div> Interview : Marcus Balogh</div>
    <div> Marcus Balogh</div>
    <div> The expansion of the EU</div>
    <div> into Central and Eastern Europe sees the reunification of a formerly divided continent .</div>
    <div> What are your thoughts on this ?</div>
    <div> Hans-Dietrich Genscher</div>
    <div> This is a historic</div>
    <div> milestone . And not only because the</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> has</div>
    <div> 450</div>
    <div> million citizens as of May</div>
    <div> 1</div>
    <div> . If one were to speak of a European miracle then this would be it for me – the fact that , after the Second World War and starting with the six founding countries , the people of Europe have managed to come together to decide their future collectively .</div>
    <div> Will the eastward expansion be an economic</div>
    <div> burden for the EU in the next few years ?</div>
    <div> The enlargement process is not something that was planned in a hurry . Important economic issues were addressed in advance . This is particularly the case for Poland , Slovakia , the Czech Republic , and Hungary . I see major opportunities for new and old members alike .</div>
    <div> The EU successfully launched the common</div>
    <div> market and the euro . Do you think that the</div>
    <div> challenges of the future will lie in consolidating what has been achieved – or should new</div>
    <div> initiatives be developed ?</div>
    <div> The</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> should</div>
    <div> not be content with all that it has achieved to date . On the contrary . The</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> must proceed boldly – and I am optimistic that this will happen .</div>
    <div> What are the challenges facing the EU ?</div>
    <div> Firstly , the</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> must complete the process of European unification that it has embarked upon . We took an important step in this direction on May</div>
    <div> 1</div>
    <div> . The second main challenge will lie in making a significant contribution to creating the new world order .</div>
    <div> “ We should avoid a situation in which the European Union becomes surrounded by a huge moat – be it political , environmental , or economic .”</div>
    <div> Hans-Dietrich Genscher</div>
    <div> What do you mean by new world order ?</div>
    <div> The world is becoming a smaller place . Increased cooperation also means that we are becoming more dependent on each other . In such an interdependent world , national developments will inevitably have implications for the rest of the world . We cannot be disinterested in events taking place around the world that are disruptive or that upset the order of things – be they economic , environmental , political or , even worse , military events . The question is , what can Europe contribute to this new world order ?</div>
    <div> What is your opinion in this regard ?</div>
    <div> The European Union can serve as an example to the world with its structure , which is based on equal cooperation for small and large countries , on common values , and on collective responsibility .</div>
    <div> Another important factor is the outlook of the</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> , the most powerful country in the world . But China , with</div>
    <div> 1.3</div>
    <div> billion citizens , is becoming an economic factor of increasing importance – not only as an exporter of consumer goods but also as an importer of jobs . A country like China cannot be excluded from decision-making bodies that determine the future of the planet . Take the</div>
    <div> G8</div>
    <div> Summit for example : there you have France , the</div>
    <div> UK</div>
    <div> , Italy , Germany , Canada , the</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> , Japan , and Russia . But where is China ? And what about India ? With a billion people it is the largest democracy in the world .</div>
    <div> Should Europe champion these countries ?</div>
    <div> In the long term , we will only enjoy prosperity if our neighbors prosper . We should therefore avoid a situation in which the European Union becomes surrounded by a huge moat – be it political , environmental , or economic . We should work towards a world order in which we can become comfortable with no longer being the center of the universe and in which the importance of other regions increases . We should also ensure that this world order is not confrontational , but rather based on cooperation . Cooperation offers more opportunities than confrontation .</div>
    <div> And how do you perceive Switzerland ’ s</div>
    <div> role ?</div>
    <div> If I were Swiss , I would ask myself ,</div>
    <div> do I want to co-determine the future or do I want to watch from the sidelines ? I have always said that the</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> is incomplete without Switzerland . Only Switzerland can decide if it can live without the</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> . The country certainly doesn ’ t need anyone from outside telling it the answer .</div>

    <div heading="article"> Romania seeks to build reputation</div>
    <div> Over the last few years , Romania was hit repeatedly by widely publicized setbacks . Corruption , trade in children , and the creaking remnants of the old command economy regularly produced strongly negative headlines . Now , for the first time since</div>
    <div> 1989</div>
    <div> , the country seems to have found cause for cautious optimism .</div>

The country may be struggling with a negative image abroad , but for Hollywood film producers it is an attractive location that provides unforgettable landscapes and labor that is both skilled and affordable .</div>
    <div> What is your experience of working with</div>
    <div> the Romanian authorities ?</div>
    <div> We haven ’ t had any serious problems . Quite the opposite , in fact . The authorities are helpful and respond quickly , but occasionally are a bit bureaucratic in their approach .</div>
    <div> What do foreign companies in Romania</div>
    <div> need to watch out for ?</div>
    <div> It is important to maintain good contact with the authorities – which are , after all , interested in creating more jobs . The best region for investment is the western part of the country . Foreign investors should make sure they complete all their transactions correctly .</div>
    <div> What is the next hurdle for Romania ?</div>
    <div> The traditional problem of high inflation finally seems to have been brought under control . It is also important to continue the reforms aimed at</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> compatibility . Reduction of the foreign debt is another significant challenge in this regard . We feel that the sooner the country joins the EU the better . Finally , we would like to see a more rigorous approach in fighting corruption . ( ba )</div>
    <div> Change for the better</div>
    <div> After the fall of communism in the wake of the bloody revolution of</div>
    <div> 1989</div>
    <div> , Romania ’ s image abroad was tarnished by a number of scandals and the country became known as a place of illegal immigration , abhorrent orphanages , and harsh poverty affecting the majority of its citizens . Even then , this reputation did not match the reality of the country , and the Romania of today is scarcely recognizable . The fact that the producers of the American dream have established a presence here is just one among many little known signs of change over the last few years .</div>
    <div> International political recognition</div>
    <div> Political stability and a booming economy have delivered a period of sustained growth in Romania for the first time since the fall of the Iron Curtain . In the last few years , growth has averaged</div>
    <div> 5</div>
    <div> percent per year , representing one of the highest growth rates in Europe . The country ’ s economic policy – for many years an issue of concern at international levels – has finally met with the approval of the International Monetary Fund (</div>
    <div> IMF</div>
    <div> ), and after five embarrassing failures since</div>
    <div> 1989</div>
    <div> , Romania finally managed to launch its first</div>
    <div> IMF</div>
    <div> program last year . This , in addition to the country ’ s</div>
    <div> NATO</div>
    <div> membership , is an important step toward full</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> membership , which Romania hopes to achieve by</div>
    <div> 2007</div>
    <div> .</div>
    <div> Fear of overheating</div>
    <div> Naturally , this growth has brought with it changes to the lifestyle of Romanians . The previous three-digit inflation rate , which stayed at around</div>
    <div> 50</div>
    <div> percent in recent years , is this year likely to be below</div>

    <div> , thanks to stringent controls over government expenditures . Romania is currently experiencing a boom in consumer spending , which is shored up by rising salaries and eased credit regulations . This has led to explosive growth in the number of restaurants , new construction projects and renovation of old buildings , plus to a surge in demand for consumer durables due to Romanians ’ spending spree on refrigerators , washing machines and televisions . For the first time since the end of the communist era , the central bank has voiced concerns about the boom , warned against overheating in the economy , and raised interest rates in an effort to dampen demand .

Of course , they are aware that there are still problems . The country is still plagued by corruption , and severe poverty continues to afflict those living outside the main cities . As in earlier times , a number of state enterprises continue to produce goods that no one wants to buy . Although they provide jobs in regions with few other employment opportunities , these industrial relics are a drain on the national treasury . Nevertheless , optimism has been rekindled in Romania and a mood is emerging that has rarely been felt since</div>
    <div> 1989</div>
    <div> . The Romanians want to see their economy heading into a favorable wind and are prepared to support further necessary reforms . And many Romanians are convinced that , for the first time since</div>
    <div> 1989</div>
    <div> , the future for the economy looks bright .</div>

    <div heading="article"> A new tiger economy in south-eastern Europe ?</div>
    <div> Bulgaria happily accedes to the suggestion that it is the south-eastern European tiger economy . When it comes to foreign and economic policies , the country is the most exemplary of the international institutions . However , only a minority enjoys the benefits of the country ’ s economic success .</div>
    <div> Urs Fitze , a freelance journalist</div>
    <div> �</div>
    <div> In the shade of a grove of trees in Bansko , a south-west tourist region in Bulgaria , a group of women hang freshly picked tobacco leaves to dry on a hemp cord . The women work for Ivan Kehajov , former head of the local collective farm and now a commercial tobacco farmer . He complains eloquently about how his business is being ruined by Bulgartabak , a tobacco company still owned by the state , and the complex workings of Bulgarian bureaucracy . The women earn the equivalent of</div>
    <div> CHF 5</div>
    <div> for a working day of</div>
    <div> 12</div>
    <div> hours . His automated drying facility – for which he paid a fortune in the west – was never brought into commission because the production quota , allocated by a state commission , was reduced overnight without warning . The drying facility is not profitable for the</div>
    <div> 10</div>
    <div> hectares he is currently allowed to farm ; his remaining</div>
    <div> 40</div>
    <div> hectares lie fallow . This is why he has hired the women , who in turn are pleased for the opportunity to earn what money they can . In many cases , their husbands are unemployed and their families subsist on what they can grow in their small fields . The money from the tobacco farm is an additional source of income that is used to buy the staples : flour , rice , and other foodstuffs that they cannot grow themselves . Very little is left over for anything else . Kehajov retains about</div>
    <div> CHF 40,000</div>
    <div> of the</div>
    <div> CHF 80,000</div>
    <div> a year brought in by his tobacco farm . His</div>
    <div> 50</div>
    <div> seasonal workers combined earn half this amount .</div>
    <div> Disillusionment after 13 years</div>
    <div> The example illustrates the difficulties facing Bulgaria</div>
    <div> 13</div>
    <div> years after the fall of the communist regime . The initial euphoria has dissipated . Since then , no government has been able to protect the majority of the population from the harsh consequences of economic transformation in the country . Bulgaria has lost most of its traditional trading partners in the east , and has turned to the west . Even the National Movement ( elected to power three years ago and led by Simeon II , the former Tsar of Bulgaria who was dethroned as a child and sent into exile by the communists in</div>
    <div> 1946</div>
    <div> ) has been unable to relieve the distressed situation of the people , especially those living outside the cities . Bulgaria ’ s gross national product is still below the level of the early</div>
    <div> 1980s</div>
    <div> . According to statistics from the World Bank , one quarter of the population is living below the poverty line , and the gap between rich and poor has steadily widened over the last few years . Hundreds of thousands of Bulgarians have emigrated . However , the country ’ s economic progress is impressive , despite the enormous social problems . Annual growth since</div>
    <div> 2000</div>
    <div> has been high – at</div>
    <div> 4</div>
    <div> to</div>
    <div> 5</div>
    <div> percent – and has given rise to the suggestion that Bulgaria is the tiger economy of south-eastern Europe . Unemployment has also been falling steadily and currently stands at</div>
    <div> 13.5</div>
    <div> percent . However , the boom has been limited primarily to the major economic centers in the cities of Sofia , Varna , Plovdiv , Burgas , and Sandanski , while large areas of the country in the north and south-west have continued their slide into poverty .</div>
    <div> Government claims to have the right answers</div>
    <div> Negotiations to join the</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> have progressed well and Bulgaria has been recognized as having a “ fully functioning market economy ”. No one now doubts that the country will accede to the</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> in</div>
    <div> 2007</div>
    <div> . Of the</div>
    <div> 30</div>
    <div> dossiers in the “ acquis communautaire ”,</div>
    <div> 25</div>
    <div> have been finalized . The prospect of soon joining the</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> has become a trump card that the Bulgarian government is not willing to relinquish . It claims to have all the right answers for the economy and has been highly praised by international institutions . Although corruption has not been eliminated entirely from daily life , it has been reduced significantly from the levels of recent years . Together with the Czech Republic , Bulgaria is ranked</div>
    <div> 54</div>
    <div> on Transparency International ’ s corruption index , placing it in the upper middle range of the</div>
    <div> 133</div>
    <div> countries included in the study .</div>
    <div> Staying the course for EU membership</div>
    <div> Despite this progress , the chances of the government being re-elected at next year ’ s elections are minimal . The poorer sections of the population that saw Simeon II as their hope for the future are turning away from his party in disappointment . Surveys show that the National Movement ’ s support has decreased , reducing it to a minor party . However , even this political rejection is unlikely to seriously threaten Bulgaria ’ s course for the future . The next government , which will probably be led by the socialists , will continue to pursue</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> accession , while domestic politics will revolve around squabbling over the best positions , in other words , business as usual in Bulgaria . In a country that has become an economic engine in the crisesstricken Balkans , those who can come to terms with the situation there will do pretty well .</div>

    <div> , three years after Russia had emerged from one of its worst economic crises , the country ’ s greatest wish was to be admitted to the league of industrialized nations as an equal partner .</div>
    <div> In order to achieve this ambitious goal , economic policy had to be put on a path of sustainable growth if the general standard of living was to be raised , and a stable political climate was essential . The key to this policy was the country ’ s enormous natural resources and its trade surpluses in most manufacturing sectors .</div>
    <div> Huge opportunities beckoned to foreign investors because so many economic sectors , notably the banking industry , the services sector and the consumer goods industry , were headed in a new direction . Economic policy increasingly focused on small and medium enterprises in an effort to support economic growth as broadly as possible . A well-educated population was and is an advantage to the Russian economy . And the</div>
    <div> SME</div>
    <div> sector , which had previously been neglected , offered tremendous investment opportunities .</div>
    <div> 1998</div>
    <div> thus introduced a fundamental change .</div>
    <div> China</div>
    <div> Since</div>
    <div> 1978</div>
    <div> , the Middle Kingdom has been on a singular path of economic reform and modernization . China ’ s per capita</div>
    <div> GDP</div>
    <div> has tripled from</div>
    <div> USD 352</div>
    <div> in</div>
    <div> 1991</div>
    <div> to</div>
    <div> USD 1,091</div>
    <div> in</div>
    <div> 2003</div>
    <div> . The population of</div>
    <div> 1.3</div>
    <div> billion makes up almost a quarter of the world ’ s population . The level of education is rising continuously . The country has not only developed into a world manufacturing base , it has also become an important foreign market for goods from all parts of the globe .</div>
    <div> India</div>
    <div> India , and especially its new middle class , has a rapidly growing consumption potential . In addition , the young generation is well</div>

    <div> educated and has studied at universities that are supported by major state investment . The levels of specialized knowledge in pharmaceutical research , software development , engineering , mathematics , and financial analysis are internationally competitive . Consumption , supported by the national market , and exports are dual drivers for a rapidly growing economy . Where infrastructure is still lacking in efficiency and quality , improvements have been initiated . Last but not least , India has also made clear progress in improving its relations with China and Pakistan .</div>
    <div> What has changed the most over recent years ?</div>
    <div> Russia</div>
    <div> In the course of the last three years , the Russian economy has recorded continuing growth of</div>
    <div> 6.5</div>
    <div> percent p . a .</div>
    <div> The political and economic environment has also stabilized considerably in the last few years . After the successful implementation of tax reforms , tax discipline has improved significantly and tax receipts have risen . Living conditions have improved markedly and Russia is experiencing a consumption boom . Management skills have increased while , at the same time , capital flight has decreased and the economy has invested in modern technology and operational facilities .</div>
    <div> China</div>
    <div> Since the opening of the country , China has become increasingly attractive to foreign direct investors . With</div>
    <div> USD 500</div>
    <div> billion , China is globally the country with the largest share of foreign direct investment . China ’ s private sector now makes up over half of total</div>
    <div> GDP</div>
    <div> , and there has been a clear separation of state and economy .</div>
    <div> India</div>
    <div> At the corporate level , there has been a massive reduction in debt and a sharper focus on operational profitability , return on equity , and free cash flows . Significant quality improvements have been achieved in the services and manufacturing sectors . More and more companies are now turning towards export and outsourcing to increase earnings . At the public sector level , privatization of state companies has been pushed , the private sector has been subsidized less , and , at the same time , has become more crucial to economic growth . Finally , the government is working towards reducing bureaucratic hurdles for foreign investors .</div>
    <div> How large is economic growth ?</div>
    <div> Russia</div>
    <div> In the last three years , growth was about</div>
    <div> 6.5</div>
    <div> percent p . a . Growth is expected to be at the same level this year , although the government ’ s estimate is a more conservative</div>
    <div> 4.5</div>
    <div> percent . In the first quarter of</div>
    <div> 2004</div>
    <div> it was</div>
    <div> 8</div>
    <div> percent .</div>
    <div> China</div>
    <div> Growth was</div>
    <div> 7.5</div>
    <div> percent in</div>
    <div> 2001</div>
    <div> ,</div>
    <div> 8</div>
    <div> percent in</div>
    <div> 2002</div>
    <div> , and</div>
    <div> 9.1</div>
    <div> percent last year . In the first quarter of</div>
    <div> 2004</div>
    <div> the growth rate equaled</div>
    <div> 9.8</div>
    <div> percent . The anticipated growth rate for the next three years is approximately</div>
    <div> 8</div>
    <div> percent p . a .</div>
    <div> India</div>
    <div> Growth in the Indian economy was</div>
    <div> 4.4</div>
    <div> percent in</div>
    <div> 2001</div>
    <div> ,</div>
    <div> 5.6</div>
    <div> percent in</div>
    <div> 2002</div>
    <div> , and</div>
    <div> 4.3</div>
    <div> percent in</div>
    <div> 2003</div>
    <div> . We expect growth this year to be about</div>
    <div> 7.5</div>
    <div> percent ; it is also likely to be at about this level in</div>
    <div> 2005</div>
    <div> and</div>
    <div> 2006</div>
    <div> .</div>
    <div> Which sectors are driving growth ?</div>
    <div> Russia</div>
    <div> Growth is especially due to domestic investment , construction , and domestic consumption . Commodities and oil contribute a large share of</div>
    <div> GDP</div>
    <div> – oil and gas alone make up one third . Other sectors such as services , banking and consumer goods are also developing fast and will play an increasingly important role in the near future .</div>
    <div> China</div>
    <div> Foreign direct investment has created jobs and contributed noticeably to economic development (</div>
    <div> 42</div>
    <div> percent of</div>
    <div> GDP</div>
    <div> ). This has significantly raised the income level , which positively impacts domestic consumption . The automobile , oil and gas , commodities and energy sectors are the most important sectors and will retain their position in future due to continuing growth .</div>
    <div> India</div>
    <div> Domestic consumption is the most important contributor to India ’ s economic development and makes up approximately</div>
    <div> 77</div>
    <div> percent of</div>
    <div> GDP</div>
    <div> . The remaining</div>
    <div> 23</div>
    <div> percent is accounted for by foreign direct investment . In</div>
    <div> 2003</div>
    <div> ,</div>
    <div> USD 5</div>
    <div> billion of foreign direct investment was recorded in India , compared to</div>
    <div> USD 54</div>
    <div> billion in China . The three largest sectors in</div>
    <div> MSCI</div>
    <div> India are energy (</div>
    <div> 23</div>
    <div> percent ), finance (</div>
    <div> 17</div>
    <div> percent ) and</div>
    <div> IT</div>
    <div> (</div>
    <div> 16</div>
    <div> percent ).</div>
    <div> The recent election results could lead to the energy sector , which has profited strongly from privatization , losing in importance over the next few years , and sectors that are less politically influenced increasing in significance , such as</div>
    <div> IT</div>
    <div> and pharmaceuticals .</div>
    <div> What is the situation with regard to national debt and currency reserves ?</div>
    <div> Russia</div>
    <div> The ratio of debt to</div>
    <div> GDP</div>
    <div> has fallen from</div>
    <div> 90</div>
    <div> to</div>
    <div> 30</div>
    <div> percent between</div>
    <div> 1999</div>
    <div> and</div>
    <div> 2003</div>
    <div> . The Russian central bank is building up reserves , which currently amount to</div>
    <div> USD 84</div>
    <div> billion . Last year , the government also founded a stabilization fund to which the surplus from the oil industry is channeled . It currently stands at</div>
    <div> USD 12</div>
    <div> billion . The government intends to pay debt liabilities with this money if the oil price should suffer a drastic collapse .</div>
    <div> China</div>
    <div> China ’ s budget deficit is currently</div>
    <div> USD 40</div>
    <div> billion and is running at</div>
    <div> 6.8</div>
    <div> percent of total state income . Overall national debt is</div>
    <div> 12.6</div>
    <div> percent of</div>
    <div> GDP</div>
    <div> . China ’ s foreign exchange reserves , already the second largest in the world , currently amount to</div>
    <div> USD 440</div>
    <div> billion .</div>

    <div> In Focus</div>
    <div> India</div>
    <div> India ’ s total national debt amounts to</div>
    <div> 76</div>
    <div> percent of</div>
    <div> GDP</div>
    <div> and remains a constraint to its economic development . A large share of national debt is cross-held between state agencies . Foreign exchange reserves currently amount to</div>
    <div> USD 118</div>
    <div> billion .</div>
    <div> How stable is the political and economic situation ?</div>
    <div> Russia</div>
    <div> When Vladimir Putin was elected president in</div>
    <div> 2000</div>
    <div> , his first step was to restructure the Kremlin power base . The Kremlin parties also gained an absolute majority in the parliamentary elections of December</div>
    <div> 2003</div>
    <div> . Both these events were needed to stabilize the political environment . The government is now promoting structural reform – even in socially delicate areas . The government is composed of well-known economists and politicians who feel a strong obligation to promote reform . Parliamentary support for the reform process is indispensable if the reform program is to be implemented in a timely manner without interference by economically influential groups or extra-parliamentary political groupings .</div>
    <div> What hurdles must be overcome next ?</div>
    <div> Russia</div>
    <div> Economic growth is clearly dependent on the government pushing ahead with the announced reforms . Uneconomic sectors of the economy , such as electricity , gas and transport , must be restructured . In the interest of more stability , the government must protect property rights and create the framework conditions for attracting foreign capital .</div>
    <div> China</div>
    <div> China ’ s main requirements are reforms to the banking and financial system , solutions for bad debts , and further improvements in the operational efficiency of state enterprises . Tools for macroeconomic management must be improved , and the gap between rich and poor regions must be narrowed .</div>
    <div> India</div>
    <div> India must continue its political development and introduce further economic reforms . Many Indian companies are still not competitive at an international level . An important factor is the struggle against poverty , which automatically leads to a demand for further large investments in infrastructure . This is a constraint to economic growth .</div>

    <div> China</div>
    <div> China ’ s political foundation has remained stable after the seamless transfer of power from Jiang Zeming to Hu Jintao at the start of</div>
    <div> 2003</div>
    <div> . The relationship with Taiwan is still tense and uncertainty about future developments has not abated . Since China ’ s accession to the World Trade Organization , implementation of the proposed reform and liberalization steps has accelerated and the equity markets and regulatory authorities are becoming increasingly transparent .</div>
    <div> India</div>
    <div> Economic development is robust , but the political future remains unclear . It also remains to be seen what the political consequences will be of a possible coalition between the government party and the communists .</div>

    <div heading="article"> China joins the global market</div>
    <div> The more it grows , the more China takes on the economic stature of an emerging economic superpower . The Chinese economy has the highest growth rate in the world and offers unique opportunities for foreign investors .</div>
    <div> Jiannan Wang , Fund Selection</div>
    <div> “ The Chinese have gained achievements in only</div>
    <div> 20</div>
    <div> years which would take many other countries two centuries to accomplish ,” commented James Wolfensohn , Chairman of the World Bank , in a recent interview . Direct foreign investment in China has indeed grown at a breathtaking rate since the country joined the World Trade Organization in</div>
    <div> 2001</div>
    <div> . The private sector has profited the most from this development , showing a much higher growth rate than that of state enterprises . China ’ s capital markets are also expanding very rapidly . Despite strong state control , China ’ s equity markets have joined the global markets , primarily via what are called “</div>
    <div> B</div>
    <div> ” and “</div>
    <div> H</div>

    <div> A</div>

    <div> H</div>
    <div> ” equities in particular combine growth opportunities with western-style disclosure standards .</div>
    <div> The current efforts of the Chinese government to slow the economy are concentrated on capital-intensive sectors that show signs of overheating , such as automobiles , aluminum , steel , cement and real estate . In the short term , the equity markets could be hit strongly by an investor over-reaction , but a hard landing for the Chinese economy is relatively unlikely .

  <article n="14">
    <div heading="article"> Russia waits for growth to take off</div>
    <div> A stable political environment following the re-election of Vladimir Putin as president , improved economic conditions and , in particular , growing consumer spending suggest that the Russian growth story is only just beginning .</div>
    <div> Jiannan Wang , Fund Selection</div>
    <div> Recent events have also impacted the Moscow Stock Exchange . Price corrections followed on the heels of increased volatility in global markets , but have also been stoked by the financial situation of the giant oil company Yukos . Although the Russian economy has diversified considerably compared to a few years ago , equity markets are still dominated by the oil industry . Oil companies represent more than</div>
    <div> 75</div>
    <div> percent of market capitalization on the Moscow Stock Exchange . In the short term , this means that general market performance is closely tied to the price movements in the oil and gas sectors . In addition , Russian equity markets suffer from lower-than-average liquidity and are therefore highly susceptible to global equity market sentiment . However , we are convinced that strong economic growth from consumer spending and construction investment will once again have a positive effect on equity markets . Russia has been one of the best-performing emerging markets for many years . Even after considerable price gains , the Russian equity markets still have upside potential . Many of the pending reforms , especially in banking , land and administration , and the restructuring process in the energy sector will have a positive influence on economic structures and equity markets .</div>
    <div> Dominance on world markets is essential</div>
    <div> The Clariden Russia Equity Fund invests in a focused portfolio consisting mainly of large , liquid stocks in the energy , telecommunications , life insurance and metal sectors . The quota of oil and gas stocks is currently around</div>
    <div> 55</div>

    <div> The Indian economy is displaying pronounced vitality . The Mumbai Stock Exchange has a history spanning</div>
    <div> 128</div>
    <div> years and today boasts around</div>

    <div> Jiannan Wang , Fund Selection</div>
    <div> After strong performance in</div>
    <div> 2003</div>
    <div> , Indian equity markets are currently under pressure . The primary reasons for the volatility are uncertainty following the election results in May and a flood of new issues . The risk of possible disappointment due to lower corporate profits is also dampening spirits . In the light of the inclusion of left-wing parties in the new coalition government , there has been much skepticism since the elections about the future of the existing reform program , especially privatization plans , agricultural reforms , and reform of subsidies , for example in the labor market . However , there is general consensus on the fact that India is the second most dynamic economy in the world ( topped only by China ) and its growth momentum remains intact . The Congress Party ’ s aim to achieve annual</div>
    <div> GDP</div>
    <div> growth of ten percent is remarkable . India remains the Asian software focal point and has also become one of the most important locations for the outsourcing of call centers by international companies .</div>

    <div> India Fund . The selection of equities is not tied to the benchmark , allowing the fund ’ s portfolio to diverge significantly from the index . The current portfolio , for example , is overweighted in the industrial and commodities sectors , and underweighted in financials and non-cyclical consumer goods . Given the risk factors associated with the Indian equity markets , the fund ’ s strategy is to minimize these risks while at the same time seeking new investment opportunities . The bull market has further increased the fund manager ’ s sensitivity to valuation-based problems . Despite increasing risk aversion , the fund strategy reflects a positive outlook</div>

    <div> The decision to join the</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> has previously always resulted in impressive development for candidate countries . This is also likely to be the case with the most recent accession states . The two products discussed here are examples from a wide range of potential structures that enable investors to gain exposure to this development .</div>
    <div> Florence Schnydrig and Daniel Shashoua , Structured Derivatives Team , and Lars Kalbreier , Trading Strategy</div>
    <div> If one examines the performance of the stock market indices of previous</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> accession candidates , one finds that these indices show an average</div>
    <div> 76</div>
    <div> percent outperformance within two years of the decision to join the</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> . For our calculations we have used the time period between confirmation of accession by the candidate countries and the official date of their</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> integration . The Spanish</div>
    <div> IBEX</div>
    <div> Index , for example , outperformed the</div>
    <div> DAX</div>
    <div> Index by</div>
    <div> 40</div>
    <div> percent in the almost two-year period after</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> acceptance . Portugal , Greece , Sweden and Finland also outperformed strongly in their equivalent periods .</div>
    <div> Impetus for investment</div>
    <div> At present , the investment world still regards the Eastern European accession countries as emerging markets . Soon , however , they will probably be viewed as Western European investment regions , and their stock markets subsumed into the sectoral allocations for the eurozone – just as was the case for Spain , Portugal and Greece in the</div>
    <div> 1990s</div>
    <div> . It can also be assumed that per capita</div>
    <div> GDP</div>
    <div> will increase in the accession states , that their equity markets will enjoy increasing liquidity as international investment grows , and that many local laws and restrictions on foreign investment will be overturned in future .</div>
    <div> Certificate Plus : Central &amp; Eastern Europe</div>
    <div> Investors seeking to invest in the new</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> member states are confronted by relatively illiquid markets . The</div>
    <div> CECE</div>
    <div> Index is a very good alternative to investing directly in the indices of the individual countries . The</div>
    <div> CECE</div>
    <div> was launched in</div>
    <div> 1999</div>
    <div> and is a capitalizationweighted index for Central and Eastern Europe . It is denominated in euros and encompasses all equities included in the Czech Traded Index , Hungarian Traded Index and Polish Traded Index .</div>
    <div> The recently launched Certificate Plus in euros on the</div>
    <div> CECE</div>
    <div> Index combines full exposure to the future performance of these markets with “ conditional ” capital protection . The certificate has a term of five years . Investors enjoy an indicative</div>
    <div> 100</div>
    <div> percent participation in the positive performance of the index upon expiry , although the maximum repayment is limited to</div>
    <div> 185</div>
    <div> percent . Moreover , the repayment will always be at least</div>
    <div> 100</div>
    <div> percent , even if the index does not perform positively . The capital protection is conditional because it will lapse if the underlying index loses more than</div>
    <div> 40</div>
    <div> percent of its start value at any time during the term of the certificate . In the event of this happening , the product is</div>

    <div> The Certificate Plus is a new type of structured derivative , and its appeal lies in its simplicity . It is particularly attractive for investors</div>

    <div> who are seeking exposure to rising equity prices in the new</div>

    <div> member states of Poland , the Czech Republic and Hungary . The knock-out conditions are well matched to the positive outlook for economic growth and the anticipated performance of these markets .</div>

    <div> We therefore anticipate that , in the next few years , the equities of the new accession states will be transferred from the</div>
    <div> MSCI EM</div>
    <div> Eastern Europe Index to the</div>
    <div> MSCI EMU</div>
    <div> Index , and that rating agencies such as Moody ’ s ,</div>
    <div> S &amp; P</div>
    <div> und Fitch will improve their ratings for the accession states . This will occur because these countries are improving their public finances in order to meet the Maastricht criteria , while at the same time restructuring their economies by doing away with investment restrictions and introducing liberal European trading legislation . The backing of the</div>
    <div> ECB</div>
    <div> will also reduce currency risks .</div>
    <div> Better growth prospects</div>
    <div> For all the reasons listed above , the economies of the accession states will probably grow at about twice the rate of existing</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> members . We have been tracking the stock market index performance of the new</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> members since October</div>
    <div> 1 , 2002</div>
    <div> , when</div>
    <div> the European Commission announced the official list of candidate countries for this round of enlargement . Since that date , Poland has outperformed the Euro Stoxx</div>
    <div> 50</div>
    <div> by</div>
    <div> 75</div>
    <div> percent , the Czech Republic has outperformed by</div>
    <div> 98</div>
    <div> percent and Hungary by</div>
    <div> 69</div>
    <div> percent . We believe that these countries have even more to offer .</div>
    <div> Due to their preparations for</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> membership , the new Eastern European</div>
    <div> EU</div>
    <div> countries are likely to outpace their Western European competitors . We therefore also recommend investing in Eastern European equities . Unfortunately , however , due to current liquidity constraints , there are only three tradable indices : Poland ’ s</div>
    <div> WIG 20</div>
    <div> Index , the Budapest Index in Hungary and the Prague</div>
    <div> PX 50</div>
    <div> Index in the Czech Republic .</div>
    <div> Opportunities for new candidates</div>
    <div> The new members of the enlarged EU offer</div>
    <div> significant advantages to investors due to a</div>
    <div> number of factors :</div>

    <div> Lower interest rates mean greater international and domestic investment in equities .</div>
    <div> p</div>
    <div> Businesses from current EU member</div>
    <div> states are moving to the accession countries</div>
    <div> because salary costs in Eastern Europe are</div>
    <div> two-thirds lower .</div>

    <div> The EU provides financial assistance to its</div>
    <div> new members .</div>

    <div> Unequal starting point for countries</div>
    <div> China ’ s above-average economic growth shows increasingly that the pegging of the yuan to the</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> dollar in a fixed exchange rate is disadvantageous for the economy in the long run . In an extreme scenario , it could even bring with it the danger of overheating . On a basis of purchasing power parity , experts consider the yuan to be undervalued against the dollar by between</div>
    <div> 10</div>
    <div> and</div>
    <div> 25</div>
    <div> percent . From a perspective of stable growth and low inflation , it is becoming more and more important that China finds a way to introduce a more flexible exchange rate mechanism , allowing the yuan to increase in value .</div>
    <div> Other countries in the region find themselves in a similar situation . Thailand ’ s economy continues to grow with low inflation ; the same is true in Malaysia where economic activity is recovering while inflation and unemployment remain low . Consumer demand is supporting moderate growth in Indonesia , inflation has fallen and consolidation of fiscal policy is starting to have a positive effect . Here too , an easing of the rigid exchange rate mechanisms is increasingly desirable , given the reforms in banking , law and the judiciary combined with the stable monetary policy of national banks . Singapore , the star of the</div>
    <div> ASEAN</div>
    <div> countries , has shown that a secure financial center and stringent monetary policy create the optimal environment for foreign investment while also promoting sustained domestic growth .</div>
    <div> The situation in Japan and South Korea is different . Both countries have suffered many years of economic hardship , but they too are benefiting from the positive regional trend driven by China . The latest figures confirm this : Japan ’ s</div>
    <div> GDP</div>

    <div> 500</div>
    <div> (</div>
    <div> 15.2</div>
    <div> percent ). This illustrates two wellknown empirical facts . Emerging markets outperform the industrialized countries during a recovery phase , but show below-average performance as soon as the economic recovery has peaked . This has clearly been the case since April . The</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> Purchasing Managers Index (</div>
    <div> ISM</div>
    <div> ) and leading indicators for the</div>
    <div> G7</div>
    <div> countries show this beyond a doubt .</div>
    <div> In addition to this typical cyclical pattern , important structural factors have played a role . For the first time , China has become a cornerstone in the global economy . This has driven prices sky high for many commodities . The process has been fuelled by speculative investors using vehicles such as hedge funds . With the prospect of a change in</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> fiscal policy and a slowing of growth in China , these investors began to liquidate their positions aggressively in March and April .</div>
    <div> Political risks are inevitable</div>
    <div> To say that emerging market countries are not known primarily for their political stability and predictability is an understatement , to put it mildly . In Russia , for example , the government has increased pressure on the Yukos oil company , leading to a correction in the Russian equity market . However , a reversal of capitalist principles is unlikely . The</div>
    <div> Comparison of equity indices : MSCI , SMI , S &amp; P</div>
    <div> Emerging markets are in a phase of correction</div>
    <div> It can be seen clearly how the MSCI Emerging Markets index has moved ahead of the indices in the industrialized countries during the latest recovery phase . However , its correction since April has also been much more pronounced .</div>

    <div> latest developments should rather be interpreted against the backdrop of the ongoing power struggle between the Kremlin and the oligarchs who emerged during the Yeltsin era .

These kinds of political risk are inevitable in emerging market countries . But in the medium term they are unlikely to have a major impact on a welldiversified portfolio .</div>

    <div> Correction in a bull market</div>
    <div> Emerging market equities remain attractively priced despite their strong gains : this somewhat reduces the risk of a setback . We continue to believe there are good reasons ( demographics , growth , more stable financial systems ) that speak in favor of a long-term bull phase in these markets . At present , we prefer Asian equity markets and would reinvest there from the middle of the year . Latin America is suffering more than Asia from the fall in commodity prices and is unlikely to become interesting again before</div>
    <div> 2005</div>
    <div> . As far as central Europe is concerned , convergence with western Europe is largely a fait accompli – we would reduce our positions here .</div>

  <article n="19">
    <div heading="article"> Prejudices put to the test</div>
    <div> Emerging market bonds are a small but popular sector in the field of fixed income investments . In terms of yield and volatility , they are positioned between conventional investment grade fixed income instruments and equities .</div>
    <div> Walter Mitchell , Credit Research</div>
    <div> Emerging market bonds make up some seven percent of the global bond market . They include both domestic and foreign bonds issued by governments and corporations in non-industrialized and developing countries . Most foreign bonds are issued in</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> dollars or euros , but there are also smaller niche markets for bonds in pounds sterling , Swiss francs and Japanese yen .</div>
    <div> A growing market</div>
    <div> The market for bonds in emerging market countries has grown steadily over the last ten years . It has benefited from continuously falling interest rates in the</div>
    <div> G7</div>
    <div> countries (</div>
    <div> USA</div>
    <div> , Canada ,</div>
    <div> UK</div>
    <div> , France , Italy , Japan and Germany ) and the resultant growing demand for higher yielding investments . Latin American borrowers make up approximately</div>
    <div> 50</div>
    <div> percent of the total outstanding emerging market bonds ; Asia ’ s share of the total is about</div>
    <div> 25</div>
    <div> percent followed by the European emerging market countries with around</div>

    <div> emerging market bonds were rated as speculative bonds , i . e . a rating of less than</div>
    <div> BB</div>
    <div> + in Standard &amp; Poor ’ s rating system . Over the last few years , however , the average credit</div>
    <div> Independent rating agencies play an important role in the financial services industry . The</div>
    <div> best-known rating agencies are Standard &amp; Poor ’ s and Moody ’ s . Standard &amp; Poor ’ s was</div>
    <div> formed in 1941 through the merger of Standard Statistics and Poor ’ s Publishing Company ,</div>
    <div> and Moody ’ s was founded in 1900. Today , both companies provide a range of services to</div>
    <div> financial companies , including the provision of credit ratings . Ratings are essentially a</div>
    <div> phenomenon from the USA that only recently jumped the Atlantic to become established</div>
    <div> in Europe . The rating methods can be applied equally well to a country , a company , or a</div>
    <div> bond . Ratings reflect future expectations as well as success and risk factors . These factors</div>
    <div> are examined in a complex model and summarized in a single indicator . The rating</div>
    <div> expresses the borrower ’ s economic capability , legal status and willingness to repay its debts</div>
    <div> in full and on time . Ratings of Bbb ( Moody ’ s ) or BBB – ( Standard &amp; Poor ’ s ) and higher are</div>
    <div> considered investment grade , whereas ratings below this threshold are non-investment</div>
    <div> grade , or speculative grade investments . ( Further definitions of the rating categories are</div>
    <div> provided on page 8 ).</div>
    <div> rating of emerging market countries has improved , and a large majority of the outstanding bonds are now rated</div>
    <div> BBB</div>
    <div> or higher .</div>
    <div> Yields please investors</div>
    <div> In the last ten years , emerging market bonds issued in</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> dollars achieved an annual average return of eleven percent . Yields at this level appear attractive , but of course they are also associated with a higher degree of risk . Due to their higher yields and greater levels of volatility , emerging market bonds form an asset class that is positioned between traditional investment grade fixed income investments and equities . If one uses the Sharpe ratio ( see box on page</div>
    <div> 35</div>
    <div> ) as a basis for comparison , then emerging market bonds in the last ten years have outperformed</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> equities but slightly underperformed investment grade and high yielding corporate bonds .</div>
    <div> Lower yield , better risk profile</div>
    <div> The outlook for yields on bonds of emerging market countries is very mixed at present . Fundamental credit data has improved , thereby reducing risk and volatility levels . However , the bonds have become more expensive , both in terms of their absolute yield and their yield differential ( spread ). Lower yields mean less income in the future , which is acceptable as long as the risk profile of most emerging market borrowers continues to improve . Investors seeking exposure to lower rated or even speculative bonds should supplement their existing fixed income portfolios with some emerging market bonds . In historical terms , emerging market bonds have a low correlation to investment grade bonds ( between</div>
    <div> 20</div>
    <div> and</div>
    <div> 40</div>
    <div> percent ). Bonds from emerging market</div>
    <div> countries should thus increase portfolio yields without adding very much risk .</div>

    <div> INVESTMENT PRODUCTS</div>
    <div> Credit risks play a key role</div>
    <div> As bond yields have contracted over the last few years and margins have narrowed , the best performance has been achieved by investments with the longest maturities and the biggest risks . We believe that this phase has ended . In the current market environment , in which rising</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> interest rates can be expected , investors should be reducing their maturity risk by focusing on bonds with shorter maturities that expire between</div>
    <div> 2006</div>
    <div> and</div>
    <div> 2008</div>
    <div> . Moreover , credit risks will again play a</div>
    <div> key role in determining the performance of bonds in an environment of rising yields . This is because higher returns are likely to be generated owing to the potential reduction in spreads rather than due to falls in risk-free interest rates . We therefore recommend concentrating on emerging market borrowers with a stable or improved risk profile such as Brazil (</div>
    <div> B2 / B</div>
    <div> +), Mexico (</div>
    <div> Baa2</div>
    <div> /</div>
    <div> BBB</div>
    <div> –) and Russia (</div>
    <div> Baa3</div>
    <div> /</div>
    <div> BB</div>
    <div> +). Bonds from more risk-prone countries with uncertain or worsening credit profiles , such as Ecuador (</div>
    <div> Caa1</div>
    <div> /</div>
    <div> CCC</div>
    <div> +) and Venezuela (</div>
    <div> Caa1</div>
    <div> /</div>
    <div> B</div>
    <div> –), should be avoided .</div>
    <div> Sharpe ratio</div>
    <div> The Sharpe ratio compares the return and</div>
    <div> risk of an investment . The greater the return</div>
    <div> and the lower the risk , the higher the Sharpe</div>
    <div> ratio . Investors who are not averse to risk</div>
    <div> should make their investments purely on the</div>
    <div> basis of the return , while risk-averse investors should instead base their decisions</div>
    <div> on the Sharpe ratio .</div>

    <div> Carlos Slim is the richest man in Latin America . The son of a Lebanese immigrant , the Mexican billionaire speaks hardly any English , doesn ’ t use a computer , and works</div>
    <div> 14</div>
    <div> hours a day . His credo is : buy cheap , grow fast . Whatever he touches turns to gold .</div>

    <div> �</div>
    <div> The</div>
    <div> 64-year-old</div>
    <div> Carlos Slim Helu laid the foundation for his wealth when he was a small boy – by selling sweets to his older brothers on weekends . By the age of</div>
    <div> 15</div>
    <div> he owned</div>
    <div> 44</div>
    <div> shares in Banamex ( Mexico ’ s largest bank at the time ) and had saved</div>
    <div> 5,523</div>
    <div> pesos . When he began his studies at the Universidad Autónoma de Mexico ( Unam ) at the age of</div>
    <div> 17</div>
    <div> , his bank account had risen to</div>
    <div> 31,900.26</div>
    <div> pesos . Slim has a phenomenal flair for numbers . There is a legendary story of his appearance at the annual general meeting of a company in which he had a minority share . Doing the calculations in his head , he added up the figures in the annual report and his result was only a thousandth of a decimal place off .</div>
    <div> The breakthrough deal for Carlos Slim was his takeover with other investors in</div>
    <div> 1990</div>
    <div> of Telmex , at that stage still the state-owned incumbent telephone company . The company held a monopoly on the fixed-line network in Mexico , Latin America ’ s largest economic player . Auditors valued Telmex at USD</div>
    <div> 10- 12</div>
    <div> billion . Slim took control of the company for USD</div>
    <div> 1.7</div>
    <div> billion , paying roughly</div>
    <div> 80</div>
    <div> cents per share . At the end of April</div>
    <div> 2004</div>
    <div> , Telmex shares were trading at over</div>
    <div> USD 30</div>
    <div> .</div>
    <div> Taking advantage of good connections</div>
    <div> The sensation caused by the takeover of Telmex was not restricted to Mexico . Slim was accused of enjoying more than just a passing acquaintance with the then president of Mexico , Carlos Salinas de Gortari . The fact that Slim nurtures good relations with politicians and is not afraid to use his connections is illustrated by another , more recent example : last year he donated</div>
    <div> USD 50</div>
    <div> million to pay for the restoration of the old town in Mexico City . In exchange , Andres</div>
    <div> The market capitalization of Carlos Slim ’ s empire amounts to more than</div>
    <div> USD 60</div>
    <div> billion .</div>
    <div> Manuel Lopez Obrador , the mayor of what is probably the largest city in the world , granted Slim the pre-emptive right to purchase a number of buildings in the inner city . Of course , once the renovation of the city center was completed ( paid for by Slim ’ s millions ), the buildings in question were worth considerably more than Slim ’ s initial investment . Amlo ( the popular nickname in Mexico for Mayor Lopez Obrador ) is not only a close friend of Slim , he is also currently the front runner to succeed President Vicente Fox in the next presidential election , scheduled for the summer of</div>
    <div> 2006</div>
    <div> .</div>
    <div> Not all business deals made by Carlos Slim leave such an aftertaste . Quite the contrary : he is a brilliant man and has been recognized in various forums as the best manager in Latin America over the last few years . Of course , the takeover of Telmex did open up certain opportunities . He was suddenly worth an amazing fortune , but he was also able to recognize in advance the signs of the times . Telmex was one of the first telecom companies in the world to be able to offer its</div>
    <div> clients ( functioning )</div>
    <div> ADSL</div>
    <div> connections . During the</div>
    <div> WTO</div>
    <div> ministerial conference in Cancun last summer , the entire venue was fitted with hotspots , making it possible for all those present to enjoy wireless internet access . Slim , who himself does not own a computer , gives away computers with internet connections virtually for free . In particular , younger clients are targeted for Telmex services .</div>
    <div> Slim still derives the largest share of his income from traditional fixed-line services , but believes that conventional telephony has poor prospects for the future . The internet is the technology of the future , in the Third World too . Slim believes even more strongly in mobile telecommunication . He is well positioned in this market with his company América Móvil , launched in September</div>
    <div> 2000</div>
    <div> , which lags only a few percentage points behind Telefónica , a Spanish company and the largest mobile phone operator in Latin America . Unlike his competitors , América Móvil is not willing to pay high prices per subscriber . Recently the Spanish company Telefónica paid BellSouth well over</div>
    <div> USD 500</div>
    <div> per existing subscriber for the purchase of its Latin American operations – boosting Telefónica ’ s total to</div>
    <div> 40.6</div>
    <div> million users and becoming the number one mobile phone operator in Latin America . América Móvil trails marginally with</div>
    <div> 40.4</div>
    <div> million subscribers .</div>
    <div> Cost-effective entry into Brazilian market</div>
    <div> The highest price paid by Slim per existing subscriber was</div>
    <div> USD 368</div>
    <div> last year when he took over the Brazilian mobile phone company</div>
    <div> BCP</div>
    <div> . However ,</div>
    <div> BCP</div>
    <div> has an extremely solid base market in the Sao Paulo region – the most lucrative market in Brazil .</div>

    <div heading="article"> Economic recovery despite stagnating reforms</div>
    <div> Mexico is one of the most open economies in Latin America .</div>
    <div> 80</div>
    <div> percent of its exports go to the</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> market . This has allowed Mexico to benefit from the recent recovery north of its border . However , the country has failed to follow through on important reform issues .</div>
    <div> Walter Mitchell , Credit Suisse</div>
    <div> After three years of below-average growth , Mexico is at last seeing the start of an economic recovery .</div>
    <div> GDP</div>
    <div> is projected to grow by</div>
    <div> 3.5</div>
    <div> percent this year , significantly above the average growth rate of</div>
    <div> 0.6</div>
    <div> percent from</div>
    <div> 2001</div>
    <div> to</div>
    <div> 2003</div>
    <div> . Mexico is recognized as having one of the most open economies in Latin America . Exports make up</div>
    <div> 30</div>
    <div> percent of</div>
    <div> GDP</div>
    <div> . More than</div>
    <div> 80</div>
    <div> percent of its exports go to the US market , explaining the strong trade networks between the two countries . The upswing in the</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> is gradually making itself felt across the border and is adding support to the current economic recovery in Mexico . Economic forecasts for</div>
    <div> 2005</div>
    <div> are also positive , although</div>
    <div> GDP</div>
    <div> growth could weaken depending on the sustainability of</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> growth and the impact of rising interest rates ( in the</div>
    <div> US</div>
    <div> and in Mexico ). The Mexican Central Bank has had to apply restrictive monetary measures three times since February to counter inflationary pressures . At the end of</div>
    <div> 2003</div>
    <div> , inflation was</div>
    <div> 4</div>
    <div> percent in comparison to the previous year . However , a rise in inflation is forecast for</div>
    <div> 2004</div>
    <div> . In addition , oil plays an important role in the Mexican economy . Oil price developments will also have a marked impact on future economic performance .</div>
    <div> Another significant factor for mediumterm growth prospects in Mexico is the stagnation of the government ’ s reform program . After the first half of his six-year term in office , President Fox has not managed to move ahead with reforms to stimulate the economy .</div>
    <div> Up until now , the opposition party</div>
    <div> PRI</div>
    <div> has continued to use its veto to stall legislative programs for energy , tax , and labor reforms . This is unlikely to change in the run-up to presidential elections in</div>
    <div> 2006</div>
    <div> . The delay in reforms will probably result in moderately slower growth and a weaker exchange rate . In the last two years , the value of the Mexican peso has fallen by about</div>

    <div> Slim also sets a shining example when it comes to work ethics . He is well known for his</div>
    <div> 14-hour</div>
    <div> working day . In stressful situations ( and there have been more than just a few of these in his life ), he lives almost entirely on thick cigars . A former Swiss employee reports that Slim has no hesitation when it comes to calling a meeting of his key staff at four in the morning if he deems it necessary . Until just recently , his headquarters were located in an unlikely nondescript building and his own office was not much larger than that of a normal office worker . Since then , however , Slim has relocated to offices more suited to the richest man in Latin America . But , unlike many other rich Latin Americans , Slim is not prone to showing off his wealth . The only embellishment he wears is the sweet smell of his own success .</div>
    <div> In addition , his family owns an exceptional art collection . His wife Soumaya , who died four years ago , was responsible for putting together the collection . Alongside works by Degas and Monet , Slim also owns the largest Rodin collection outside of the Rodin museum in Paris . His collection of artifacts from the Aztec Empire is considered to be better than the Mexico City Anthropological Museum ’ s holdings .</div>
    <div> Slim does not simply amass fortunes for himself and his heirs , however . He runs two charities that between them have more than</div>
    <div> USD 1</div>
    <div> billion in assets . Last year he gave almost</div>
    <div> 20,000</div>
    <div> scholarships to students , paid the bail money for about</div>
    <div> 5,000</div>
    <div> underage first-time offenders ( thereby avoiding their long wait pending trial ) and financed</div>

    <div heading="article"> The growth path is a very fine line</div>
    <div> Economic growth will pick up significantly in Latin America this year . However , the region remains susceptible to crises due to its reliance on foreign capital .</div>
    <div> Walter Mitchell , Credit Research</div>
    <div> �</div>
    <div> After three lean years , hope is re-emerging in Latin America . Real</div>
    <div> GDP</div>
    <div> growth in the region is likely to reach about</div>
    <div> 3.8</div>
    <div> percent this year . This would be the highest level of growth since</div>
    <div> 2000</div>
    <div> ( see graph below ). The recovery , from Mexico all the way to Tierra del Fuego in the south , is largely being driven by the global economic upturn , high commodity prices and larger net capital inflows . The question is , will the recovery be sustained , or will it falter on account of internal or external factors before living standards for the region ’ s people improve ?</div>
    <div> Adjustment leads to strength</div>
    <div> Latin America has emerged from a difficult period of adjustment . This process was triggered when capital flows into the region abruptly ended following the Asian and Russian crises . Previously , net private capital inflows to the region had reached a peak of</div>
    <div> USD 105</div>
    <div> billion in</div>
    <div> 1997</div>
    <div> . Inflows collapsed after this and totaled no more than</div>
    <div> USD 19</div>
    <div> billion in</div>
    <div> 2002</div>
    <div> . This led to collapsing growth rates and forced Brazil and Argentina to abandon their fixed exchange rates in</div>
    <div> 1999</div>
    <div> and</div>
    <div> 2001</div>
    <div> respectively . Latin America has emerged stronger after this dramatic period of adjustment . The last three years have not only seen a positive improvement in the trade balance in a number of countries in the region , but many countries have also enjoyed lower inflation and a reduction in public sector debt . However , the recovery is dependent on a very favorable environment , combined with rising commodity prices and record-low interest rates in the industrialized countries . Low interest rates not only reduced the cost of loans , they have also had the effect of boosting capital flows to the south . These external factors will not always be this favorable , however .</div>
    <div> Danger persists</div>
    <div> The danger of a balance of payments shock in many Latin American countries persists ( with the exception of Chile and Mexico ), despite the progress made in combating inflation and reining in government deficits . When all is said and done , whether external or internal factors trigger such a shock is unimportant . What matters is the region ’ s continuing dependency on foreign capital inflows , making it vulnerable in the event of fluctuations in international financial flows . The problem can be traced back to a low savings ratio and the limited openness of the Latin American economies . The low</div>
    <div> Promising improvement in balance of payments vs GDP</div>
    <div> In 1998 , the balance of payments deficit was 4.4 percent , while in 2003 there was a small surplus of 0.6 percent . The lean years look to be over , and there is major hope for a sustainable recovery .</div>

    <div> level of savings means that the region ’ s governments as well as private businessmen have to look abroad to raise loans . At the same time , the export sectors of most countries are too weak to generate sufficient earnings in hard currency ( i . e . assets ) to settle their liabilities , leaving the entire region in a net debt situation .</div>
    <div> Exports lag behind</div>
    <div> Exports have increased in the last few years , but this has only been due to higher commodity prices . Exports from Latin America continue to lag behind those in Asian and European countries . Panama and Chile have the most open economies , with exports of</div>
    <div> 58</div>
    <div> and</div>
    <div> 34</div>
    <div> percent respectively . The remaining countries generally fail to achieve an export ratio above</div>
    <div> 30</div>
    <div> percent . Emerging market countries in Asia and Europe boast average export rates of</div>
    <div> 52</div>
    <div> and</div>
    <div> 45</div>
    <div> percent of</div>
    <div> GDP</div>
    <div> respectively . The region ’ s vulnerability to external factors is particularly pronounced in the case of Brazil . Despite a record high trade surplus of</div>
    <div> USD 25</div>
    <div> billion in</div>
    <div> 2003</div>
    <div> , exports only make up</div>
    <div> 17</div>
    <div> percent of the country ’ s</div>
    <div> GDP</div>
    <div> . At the same time , Brazil ’ s foreign debt at the end of last year amounted to</div>
    <div> 44</div>
    <div> percent of</div>
    <div> GDP</div>
    <div> . Servicing of net debt is feasible during good years but quickly becomes a problem as soon as capital inflows decline for any reason . Brazil ’ s dependence on these capital inflows became apparent in the last few weeks when</div>
    <div> Brazil : Can Lula survive the pressure ?</div>
    <div> After 18 months in office , President Lula is still pursuing a market-friendly macroeconomic</div>
    <div> policy . He has limited increases in minimum salaries to 8 percent ( based on the expected inflation rate ) and resisted pressure for larger salary increases . Despite the clamor for</div>
    <div> an easing of the tax policy reins , he has stuck to his guns for a primary surplus of 4.25</div>
    <div> percent of GDP . But his left-wing past is catching up with him . He will be put under pressure to intervene politically , and the markets will never be sure that he won ’ t suddenly</div>
    <div> change course in midstream . This political uncertainty has resulted in slightly higher interest rates and a moderately weaker rate of economic growth . This creates an erratic</div>
    <div> scenario that only holds up as long as the friendly economic environment persists . However , if interest rates shoot up or commodity prices collapse ( especially the price of soya ),</div>
    <div> Brazil ’ s public finances and currency would come under much greater pressure , and the</div>
    <div> reserve bank would curb its pace of fiscal policy easing . The government must stay the</div>
    <div> course of its macroeconomic policy , particularly when the environment becomes less</div>
    <div> friendly .</div>
    <div> the liquidation of bond market positions coincided with a weakening in the national currency , the real ( see box on Brazil ).</div>
    <div> The people ’ s patience is becoming exhausted</div>
    <div> How can Latin America reduce its dependence on foreign capital and thereby improve its chances for sustainable growth ? The solution to becoming less dependent on external factors is the active encouragement of exports . If exports rise then there is more hard currency to service debts . Secondly , the region ’ s governments must create an attractive environment for direct foreign investment ( in equities ). This requires improvements in protecting property rights as well as a proper regulatory framework . Finally , governments will have to further reduce their budget deficits to keep inflation low and improve access to domestic savings for the private sector . It is encouraging to see that most governments in Latin America are pursuing such measures in some form or other . However , corrections to the balance of payments take a long time . And the patience of the Latin American people , and especially the poor , may well have been exhausted by then .</div>
